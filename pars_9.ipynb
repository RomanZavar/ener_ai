An air source heat pump running on renewable electricity will heat a home much more sustainably, which is why ministers are encouraging consumers to make the switch.\\u2018It\\u2019s been brilliant\\u2019: air source heat pump will recoup cost for ownerRead moreQ&AWhat are heat pumps and why is the UK government pushing them?ShowIn simple terms, an electric heat pump works like a reverse fridge, extracting warmth from the outside air, the ground or a nearby water source before concentrating the heat and transferring it indoors. They can usually be found outside a home, and they look like a standard air-conditioning unit.About 85% of UK homes use gas boilers for heating, making it one of the most polluting sectors of the economy. The fossil fuels used in our homes for heating, hot water and cooking make up more than a fifth of the UK\\u2019s carbon emissions, meaning low-carbon alternatives are critical if the UK government hopes to meet its climate targets.Jillian AmbrosePhotograph: KBImages/https://www.alamy.comWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.What are they and how do they work?In simple terms, an air source heat pump works like a reverse fridge, extracting warmth from the outside air before concentrating it and transferring it indoors to provide central heating and hot water. The pumps look like a standard air-conditioning unit and need to be situated outside the home. They will work at temperatures of minus 15c and lower, although the colder the outside temperature, the more electricity they need to consume to heat your home. Ground source heat pumps work in a similar way but collect the heat from pipes running underground. These are more efficient but are harder to retrofit to existing homes unless you are prepared to dig up your garden.An air source heat pump extracts warmth from the outside air before concentrating it and transferring it indoors to provide hot water and central heating. Photograph: Jenny Dettrick/Getty ImagesWhat does it cost to install one? Don\\u2019t believe some of the quoted prices that have appeared in recent days, someone with a family-size three-bed house and larger can expect to pay \\u00a38,000-\\u00a315,000 in total to install a complete air source system, while fitting out a bigger home will cost more. Alongside the pump, that price will include a new hot water tank and labour. The final bill will depend on whether your existing radiators are large enough or need to be replaced. You are also advised to upgrade your home\\u2019s insulation at the same time, which could add considerably to the final bill, depending on your home\\u2019s construction. Fitting a ground source pump will cost much more \\u2013 typically upwards of \\u00a315,000.What financial help is there?This week the government announced it will be giving households grants of \\u00a35,000 to help them install ASHPs, with the total money allocated enough to cover 90,000 homes. There will be grants of up to \\u00a36,000 available for ground source heat pumps.What has been less publicised is the fact that you can already apply for funding via the Renewable Heat IncentiveThe grants will be available from April 2022, and details of how consumers will apply are yet to be published. The scheme will operate for three years. It is highly likely that it will be oversubscribed, meaning those who can fulfil the criteria quickest will receive the grants.What has been less publicised is the fact that you can already apply for funding via the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI). Buyers have to pay for the work upfront and then reclaim the RHI payments, which are paid quarterly for the first seven years of ownership. The total paid to a household under the RHI depends on the measure installed, the home energy performance and the type and age of the boiler being replaced. Those replacing an old oil-fired boiler receive the most \\u2013 typically \\u00a39,000. If you replace an old gas boiler in a family-size house you can expect to receive a total \\u00a37,000. There is a calculator on the Gov website.To gain the RHI money you must use an MCS-accredited installer and there is a somewhat torturous application process. The RHI will close to new applications on 31 March 2022.What do air source heat pumps cost to run?People ripping out an inefficient old oil-burning boiler should reduce their annual energy bill by going for an ASHP \\u2013 but not by a huge amount. Those taking out a gas boiler are highly unlikely to see any savings and could well end up paying more each year. Octopus Energy says in a poorly insulated home it will cost as much as 40% more to run a heat pump rather than a traditional boiler. This is because the cost of electricity includes carbon taxes and subsidies to support low-carbon energy projects. Green groups have called on the government to move these levies on to gas bills instead to encourage households to turn their backs on oil and gas.Do they work as well as a conventional boiler?A properly installed ASHP system, which is the right size for the property, should keep house warm on the coldest winter days. They typically operate at 55C rather than the 60-80C that gas boilers will often work at, which is why they can require bigger radiators. They work particularly well with underfloor heating and are designed to keep indoor spaces at a steady temperature with gentle top-ups through the day.What are the downsides?Air source heat pumps will work at temperatures of minus 15c and lower, although the colder the outside temperature, the more electricity they need to consume to heat your home. Photograph: KBImages/AlamyThe biggest problem is that a great many UK homes are not suitable for an ASHP. Flat owners have struggled to get permission, and that\\u2019s assuming the installer has found a way to make a system work inside a confined space. Retrofitting a system with an existing boiler is not for the faint of heart on the basis that much of the plumbing will need to be replaced. You will also need a place to store a water tank.There have been concerns over the reliability and longevity of some systems. Mitsubishi pumps appear to be well regarded, as do those coming out of Scandinavia, and, more recently, the Northern Irish supplier, Red. Some installed in coastal towns have suffered premature wear because of the high salt content in the air.Is it worth it?If you are gutting and restoring a house and putting in a whole new heating system along with a major insulation upgrade, installing an ASHP \\u2013 or, even better, a ground source pump \\u2013 along with underfloor heating is a no-brainer. Equally, if you are currently running an old boiler that needs replacing anyway.Whether you will want to rip out a perfectly good, modern gas boiler will largely depend on how keen you are to move to zero carbon heating, the level of your home\\u2019s insulation and, if your insulation is poor, whether you are prepared to see your bills rise.Is it worth waiting for an alternative technology to emerge?Possibly. A great deal of investment is being put into community ground source heat systems, where whole roads, estates and tower blocks are plumbed into a central ground source that runs under the road. Simon Lomax, who runs Kensa Heat Pumps in Cornwall believes these offer a much better long-term solution as they are more efficient and durable, and don\\u2019t have many of the downsides of ASHPs. Hydrogen is the other great hope. Trials and schemes are testing whether the highly flammable element can be used safely.\",\n          \"On the Saturday before Labor Day, in the east Los Angeles neighborhood of Boyle Heights, temperatures outside climbed to 105F (41C). It was the fourth day of California\\u2019s longest September heatwave on record. That afternoon, the entire state was under a \\u201cflex alert\\u201d, in which Californians were asked to turn down their air conditioners and unplug appliances to avoid putting so much demand on the power grid that utilities would have to intermittently cut electricity.\\u2018Transformational\\u2019: could America\\u2019s new green bank be a climate gamechanger?Read moreBut at the Boyle Heights Arts Conservatory, or BHAC, children sat around a table engrossed in the role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons.

When asked what he would be doing on a hot day like this if he weren\\u2019t at the BHAC, Felix shrugged. \\u201cI\\u2019d probably be outside, trying not to die from heat.\\u201dBHAC is a career training center that has been preparing young people for jobs in media arts for 11 years. But recently, BHAC has been taking on a new role in its community \\u2013 shielding some of east Los Angeles\\u2019s most vulnerable residents from extreme weather.The conservatory is an example of what is known in California and beyond as a \\u201cresilience center\\u201d \\u2013 a community space built to withstand climate disruptions like storms and power outages, but that also builds long-term preparedness by offering programs that improve people\\u2019s social, physical and economic health so they can withstand crises. Community members have found that temporary, reactive disaster responses like emergency shelters don\\u2019t adequately protect residents, and that, especially in disadvantaged communities, climate resilience must also address pre-existing inequities.As hazards like wildfire smoke, extreme heat and power outages last longer and happen more often, more communities across California are turning to these centers for support, and the state has committed nearly $200m in funding to developing more.A pedestrian uses an umbrella in the heat in Rosemead, California. Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty ImagesBut in this age of compounding climate emergencies, it is still unclear whether enough of this type of resilience infrastructure can be built \\u2013 and quickly enough \\u2013 to meet the needs of vulnerable communities.Beginning in 2012, Kristin Baja originated the concept of resilience centers while working as Baltimore\\u2019s climate resilience planner. She was going into neighborhoods to talk to people about emergency planning, but quickly recognized residents were not interested.At least, not as long as the local government was involved.\\u201cBaltimore has a legacy of racism and intentional discrimination,\\u201d Baja said. \\u201cIt became really clear that community members were not going to use disaster shelters because they were owned and managed by the government.\\u201dResidents also felt they had more pressing everyday concerns than when the next storm might come. High unemployment and a lack of childcare were more top of mind.To keep residents safe, solutions had to address not just weather-related hazards, but also the longstanding inequities the community faced. Baja changed course, working with residents to develop spaces that could provide backup energy, food, water and shelter \\u2013 but that would also offer after-school programs and job training.\\u201cWe\\u2019re shifting the approach from the hazard to the human,\\u201d said Baja, who is now director of direct support and innovation at the Urban Sustainability Directors Network (USDN), which helps organizations design strategies around resilience centers.By offering resources every day of the year, the center was strengthening the community\\u2019s ability to withstand disruptions, and it was building trust with residents before a crisis hit.\\u201cThey know there\\u2019s backup food, backup water, first aid,\\u201d said Baja. \\u201cThey\\u2019re much more likely to go to that space because they know they\\u2019re not going to be turned away or be treated poorly.\\u201dNot only are resilience centers more likely to be trusted by a community than government-led emergency services, they also offer a more practical and productive space to be during climate events than evacuation shelters or cooling centers.On the same Saturday that kids played Dungeons and Dragons at BHAC, only 190 people in a city of 4 million used the city\\u2019s emergency cooling centers, according to the city\\u2019s department of recreation and parks.\\u201cCooling centers are not well utilized because what you get is basically an empty gymnasium, where the temperature certainly is low, but it\\u2019s full of folding chairs and not much else,\\u201d said Chase Engelhardt, policy analyst at Climate Resolve, an advocacy group in Los Angeles.\\u201cPeople aren\\u2019t Sims,\\u201d he added, referring to the computer game. \\u201cThey won\\u2019t just go into a building, sit down for three hours and then leave once their body reaches some level of rest.\\u201dIn Boyle Heights, many residents don\\u2019t have air conditioners, or can\\u2019t afford to turn them on. To get people out of the heat, BHAC began designing programs that would attract people to the center without the stigma of needing help.Azareth Jimenez sits outside her mother\\u2019s store on Cesar E Chavez Avenue in Boyle Heights, Los Angeles.

On Saturdays, they invited families to watch cartoons and eat cereal.BHAC recently upgraded their 100-year-old building with a hospital-grade air filtration and cooling system. They have installed air quality monitors on the building so they can alert residents when breathing conditions get dangerous. Soon, the center will have solar panels and battery storage that can provide backup power for three days. They will also have a cistern that can hold 500 gallons of potable water.The upgrades are important to ensure that BHAC can stay open in the event of a climate disruption. But the center\\u2019s best tool for keeping neighbors safe is that people enjoy being there.\\u201cWe do things that allow families to come and not have to have a pretext,\\u201d Ramirez Sanchez said. \\u201cYou can just say you came in to watch cartoons.\\u201dMost resilience centers will be born out of existing neighborhood spaces that residents are familiar with. But some communities, particularly in rural areas, may find their only option is to build centers from the ground up.Tuolumne county is about a three-hour drive south-east of Sacramento. It\\u2019s largely made up of national forest and contains northern portions of Yosemite national park. The county is a few months away from completing construction on two brand-new resilience centers. The projects have been in development since 2015.In 2013, the Rim Fire burned more than 250,000 acres in the area, destroyed 11 homes and caused evacuations that lasted weeks. \\u201cWhen Tuolumne started recovering from the Rim fire, the first thing we did was talk about what would make us more resilient as a community,\\u201d said Maureen Frank, capital projects director of Tuolumne county. \\u201cThe community wanted better response and recovery to and from emergencies, but they also wanted improved access to services.\\u201dLiving in a remote area meant that many doctor\\u2019s offices were more than 30 miles away, across winding mountain passes. Riding the bus to and from the nearest food bank took a whole day. Residents lived far from one another, and felt socially isolated. They wanted a place to gather.One of the new buildings, the Groveland Community Resilience Center, is equipped with heavy-duty heating and cooling systems, fortified with an ignition-resistant exterior, backed up by a diesel power generator, and is large enough to shelter as many as 75 people indoors at a time. But it will also provide weekly food-bank distribution, offer counseling services, and host community college classes.The resilience center also has a large outdoor amphitheater for events and a walking trail for people to meet up and socialize. \\u201cIt will be a living, breathing building, used seven days a week,\\u201d said Frank.Maureen Frank and Taylor Gold stand inside what will be the main gathering space at the Groveland Resilience Center. Photograph: Gabriela AounThe centers are scheduled to open in a few months, but as construction carried on at the Groveland Resilience Center this summer, the need was clear. On a late July morning at the construction site for the Groveland Resilience Center, the sky looked clear, but the air was thick with the smell of smoke. The Oak fire was burning in neighboring Mariposa county. It destroyed more than 60 homes and forced 6,000 people to evacuate.\\u201cIt would have been nice to have this opened,\\u201d Frank said, \\u201cso we could help.\\u201dAs resilience centers prove their effectiveness, the question becomes how many can be built, and how quickly. Developing a center can cost millions of dollars. Battery storage for microgrids is still very expensive, and some buildings need substantial upgrades before they can be outfitted with solar panels or HVAC systems.Last year, California allocated $100m toward grant programs to fund resilience center projects. But Patrick Murphy, a senior scientist at the policy institute Physicians, Scientists and Engineers for Healthy Energy (PSE), said that in proportion to the need, that is merely a drop in the bucket.Through a grant from the state, PSE is working on a mapping tool to identify which communities in California are most vulnerable to climate change, power grid vulnerabilities, health disparities and socioeconomic inequalities. They\\u2019re also aiming to identify all the possible spaces in the state where resilience hubs could be developed, including schools, community centers and churches.Murphy worries that when the study is complete, it will reveal a huge need. \\u201cOne hundred million is a good start,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut this is a multibillion-dollar problem.\\u201dIn response to concerns that interest in resilience centers far exceeded available funding, the legislature directed an additional $85m to resilience center grants in a bill that Governor Gavin Newsom signed this month.Coral Abbott, community resilience centers program manager at the California Strategic Growth Council, which will distribute the funding, said that the grants will support pilot projects in rural, urban and suburban areas. \\u201cThey will be able to serve as models that can be replicated by other communities in the future,\\u201d said Abbott.In the meantime, existing centers like BHAC are already modeling how resilience centers might allow communities to not just survive climate disruptions, but to thrive through them. When Felix\\u2019s dad, Roland, came to pick him up from the Dungeons and Dragons session, he called BHAC a \\u201clifesaver\\u201d. Playing the game made his son use critical thinking skills and offered him much-needed in-person interaction with peers.And then, of course, there was the heat. \\u201cWhen it\\u2019s hot, we try to find recreation,\\u201d the elder Felix said. \\u201cThis helps.\\u201d\",\n          \"The sixth mass extinction of wildlife on Earth is accelerating, according to an analysis by scientists who warn it may be a tipping point for the collapse of civilisation.More than 500 species of land animals were found to be on the brink of extinction and likely to be lost within 20 years. In comparison, the same number were lost over the whole of the last century. Without the human destruction of nature, even this rate of loss would have taken thousands of years, the scientists said.The land vertebrates on the verge of extinction, with fewer than 1,000 individuals left, include\\u00a0the Sumatran rhino, the Clari\\u00f3n wren, the Espa\\u00f1ola giant tortoise and the harlequin frog. Historic data was available for 77 of the species and the scientists found these had lost 94% of their populations.The researchers also warned of a domino effect, with the loss of one species tipping others that depend on it over the edge. \\u201cExtinction breeds extinctions,\\u201d they said, noting that unlike other environmental problems extinction is irreversible.Humanity relies on biodiversity for its health and wellbeing, scientists said, with the coronavirus pandemic an extreme example of the dangers of ravaging the natural world. Rising human population, destruction of habitats, the wildlife trade, pollution and the climate crisis must all be urgently tackled, they said.Human society under urgent threat from loss of Earth's natural lifeRead more\\u201cWhen humanity exterminates other creatures, it is sawing off the limb on which it is sitting, destroying working parts of our own life-support system,\\u201d said Prof Paul Ehrlich, of Stanford University in the US, and one of the research team. \\u201cThe conservation of endangered species should be elevated to a global emergency for governments and institutions, equal to the climate disruption to which it is linked.\\u201dHarlequin frog. Photograph: Gerardo Ceballos/University of Mexico/PA\\u201cWe are facing our final opportunity to ensure that the many services nature provides us do not get irretrievably sabotaged,\\u201d said Prof Gerardo Ceballos of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, who led the research.\\u00a0The analysis, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, examined data on 29,400 land vertebrate species compiled by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and BirdLife International. The researchers identified 515 species with populations below 1,000 and about half of these had fewer than 250 remaining. Most of these mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians were found in tropical and subtropical regions.Scientists discovered that 388 species of land vertebrate had populations under 5,000, and the vast majority (84%) lived in the same regions as the species with populations under 1,000, creating the conditions for a domino effect.Known examples of this include the overhunting of sea otters, the main predator of kelp-eating sea urchins. A boom in urchins devastated kelp forests in the Bering Sea, leading to the extinction of the kelp-eating Steller\\u2019s sea cow.UN draft plan sets 2030 target to avert Earth's sixth mass extinctionRead moreThe researchers said their findings could aid conservation efforts by highlighting the species and regions requiring the most urgent attention.\\u00a0Prof Andy Purvis, at the Natural History Museum in London, and not part of the new analysis, said:\\u00a0\\u201cThis research provides another line of evidence that the biodiversity crisis is accelerating. The hardest problem [the researchers] faced is that we don\\u2019t know more about the history of species\\u2019 geographic distributions. They only had that information for 77 of the species on the brink, and we can\\u2019t know for sure how typical those species are.\\u201d\\u00a0Espa\\u00f1ola giant tortoise. Photograph: Gerardo Ceballos/University of Mexico/PA\\u201cBut that doesn\\u2019t undermine the conclusion,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe biodiversity crisis is real and urgent. But \\u2013 and this is the crucial point \\u2013 it is not too late. To transition to a sustainable world, we need to tread more lightly on the planet. Until then, we are essentially robbing future generations of their inheritance.\\u201d\\u00a0What is biodiversity and why does it matter to us?Read moreProf Georgina Mace, of University College London, said: \\u201cThis new analysis re-emphasises some startling facts about the extent to which vertebrate populations have been reduced worldwide by human activities.\\u201d But she said she was not convinced that simply having a population less than 1,000 was the best measure of a species being on the brink. A declining trend for the population is also important and both factors are used in the IUCN Red List, she said.\\u201cAction is important for many reasons, not least of which is that directly and indirectly we rely on the rest of life on Earth for our own health and wellbeing,\\u201d she said. \\u201cDisrupting nature leads to costly and often hard-to-reverse effects. Covid-19 is an extreme present-day example, but there are many more.\\u201dMark Wright, the director of science at WWF, said: \\u201cThe numbers in this research are shocking. However, there is still hope. If we stop the land-grabbing and devastating deforestation in countries such as Brazil, we can start to bend the curve in biodiversity loss and climate change. But we need global ambition to do that.\\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Date Published\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2207,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2020-06-26\",\n          \"2019-11-28\",\n          \"2019-06-10\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Next was Labor, which received $392,354, and last was the Nationals, which received $59,991.The Greens were not included as the party has a policy of refusing donations from fossil fuel companies and received none.By far the biggest donor was Woodside Energy, which announced last year it was pushing ahead with its $16bn project to open up the Scarborough gas field, and gave $124,000 to the Coalition and $108,350 to Labor, making for a total of $232,250.The next biggest donors were the Minerals Council of Australia, which gave $193,943 ($101,192 to the Liberals, $28,091 to the Nationals and $64,660 to Labor), and the trust for \\u201ccoal baron\\u201d Trevor St Baker, which donated $165,202. Of this, $112,758 went to the Liberal party and $52,444 to Labor.In many cases, the amounts donated skewed towards the Liberal party with groups like the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (Appea) giving the Liberal party $72,610 compared to $31,650 for Labor.\\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\\nSign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morningOther companies with controversial gas developments were also spending big.Santos, which is pursuing the $3.6bn Narrabri gas project, donated $44,000 to the Labor party but nothing to the Liberals. Meanwhile, Empire Energy Group, a gas company with strong links to the Coalition that is working to frack the Beetaloo Basin, gave $40,000 to the Liberal party and $25,000 to Labor.Shani Tager, the senior campaign manager at 350, said it was clear fossil fuel companies attempting to develop projects facing significant community opposition were attempting to buy political support.Anthony Pratt gave Liberals $1.3m while upstart political groups gain sizeable donationsRead more\\u201cIt\\u2019s companies that have high-profile projects that have a really strong pushback against them that are making these donations to shore up political support,\\u201d Tager said.With \\u201cmore money than ever\\u201d being donated by fossil fuel companies, Tager said political donations from the oil and gas sector should be banned over the risk it may influence policymaking in a way that stops action on climate change.\\u201cThe Morrison government has been really, vocally supportive of the gas industry and in addition to being supportive, they have really put their money where their mouth is, they give money to these groups,\\u201d Taber said.\\u201cThis money is buying what these companies want, and that is more subsidies and special conditions for their projects going ahead.\\u201dThe federal minister for emissions reduction, Angus Taylor, and the Labor shadow ministers, Ed Husic and Chris Bowen, were contacted for comment.Last year the International Energy Agency said limiting global heating to 1.5C, a goal set out in the Paris agreement, meant exploration and exploitation of new fossil fuel basins had to stop in 2021.\",\n          \"Countries should impose windfall taxes on fossil fuel companies and divert the money to vulnerable nations suffering worsening losses from the climate crisis, the United Nations secretary general has urged.Ant\\u00f3nio Guterres said that \\u201cpolluters must pay\\u201d for the escalating damage caused by heatwaves, floods, drought and other climate impacts, and demanded that it was \\u201chigh time to put fossil fuel producers, investors and enablers on notice\\u201d.\\u201cToday, I am calling on all developed economies to tax the windfall profits of fossil fuel companies,\\u201d Guterres said in a speech to the UN general assembly on Tuesday. \\u201cThose funds should be redirected in two ways \\u2013 to countries suffering loss and damage caused by the climate crisis and to people struggling with rising food and energy prices.\\u201dGuterres\\u2019s appeal came in his most urgent, and bleakest, speech to date on the state of the planet, and the will of governments to change course.His first words were: \\u201cOur world is in big trouble.\\u201d\\u201cLet\\u2019s have no illusions. We are in rough seas. A winter of global discontent is on the horizon, a cost-of-living crisis is raging, trust is crumbling, inequalities are exploding and our planet is burning,\\u201d he told the assembly. \\u201cWe have a duty to act and yet we are gridlocked in colossal global dysfunction. The international community is not ready or willing to tackle the big dramatic challenges of our age.\\u201dThe lacerating speech, delivered at the UN headquarters in New York, echoes calls from activists, and the European Union, to tax major oil and gas firms currently enjoying record profits in the wake of Russia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. In July, Exxon announced it had made a record quarterly profit of $17.8bn, while Chevron unveiled its own three-month record profit, of $11.6bn. BP, meanwhile, made a $8.5bn profit in the same period.Under Guterres\\u2019s proposal, revenue from the taxes would flow to predominantly developing countries suffering \\u201closs and damage\\u201d from global heating, to be invested in early warning systems, mopping up from disasters and other initiatives to build resilience. Vulnerable countries are poised to leverage the UN general assembly week to ask rich nations for a \\u201cclimate-related and justice-based\\u201d global tax to pay for loss and damage.Guterres has previously accused governments of having an \\u201caddiction\\u201d to fossil fuels and has called new investments in oil, coal and gas \\u201cmoral and economic madness\\u201d.But his speech on Tuesday was particularly pointed, delivered on the grand dais of the general assembly and following the secretary general\\u2019s recent visit to Pakistan, where floods from what he called \\u201ca monsoon on steroids\\u201d have submerged a third of the country and displaced millions of people.\\u201cOur planet is burning,\\u201d Guterres said, calling on world leaders to to end their \\u201csuicidal war against nature\\u201d.\\u201cThe climate crisis is the defining issue of our time,\\u201d he added. \\u201cIt must be the first priority of every government and multilateral organization. And yet climate action is being put on the back burner \\u2013 despite overwhelming public support around the world.\\u201d\\u201cWe have a rendezvous with climate disaster \\u2026 The hottest summers of today may be the coolest summers of tomorrow. Once-in-a-lifetime climate shocks may soon become once-a-year events. And with every climate disaster, we know that women and girls are the most affected. The climate crisis is a case study in moral and economic injustice.\\u201dGovernments must stage an \\u201cintervention\\u201d to break their addiction to fossil fuels, Guterres said, by targeting not only the extractive companies themselves but the entire infrastructure of businesses that support them.\\u201cThat includes the banks, private equity, asset managers and other financial institutions that continue to invest and underwrite carbon pollution,\\u201d said the secretary general.\\u201cAnd it includes the massive public relations machine raking in billions to shield the fossil fuel industry from scrutiny. Just as they did for the tobacco industry decades before, lobbyists and spin doctors have spewed harmful misinformation. Fossil fuel interests need to spend less time averting a PR disaster \\u2013 and more time averting a planetary one.\\u201dGuterres said it was \\u201chigh time to move beyond endless discussions\\u201d and deliver finance for vulnerable countries and for wealthy nations to double adaption funding by 2025, as they promised to do at UN climate talks in Scotland last year. A further round of talks, known as Cop27, will take place in Egypt in November, in which loss and damage is set to be a central issue.Although governments have agreed to restrain global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial times, almost all countries are lagging in their efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions quickly enough to avoid this level of heating and therefore avert catastrophic climate impacts.Emissions have already rebounded to pre-pandemic levels and an analysis this week showed there are plenty of known fossil fuel reserves in the world still left to burn \\u2013 enough to unleash 3.5tn tons of greenhouse gases, which would smash the carbon budget before we get to 1.5C seven times over.\",\n          \"Running the entire width of one floor at London\\u2019s Hayward gallery is a six-screen video which depicts, at about life size, a spruce tree swaying in the breeze in Finland. To accommodate its scale, the tree is projected horizontally, and at its foot stands the artist Eija-Liisa Ahtila, in a blue parka, dwarfed by the spreading conifer. The six projected sections of the tree tremble and sway out of sync with one another, adding to a growing sense of majestic befuddlement. You can\\u2019t take it in all at once, any more than you could if you stood before the real thing. Distantly, I hear the branches soughing and faint birdsong. Titled Horizontal \\u2013 Vaakasuora, it makes you look and look some more.Horizontal \\u2013 Vaakasuora is one of the highlights of Among the Trees, an exhibition that fills the Hayward with a knotty tangle of romanticism, wood carving and trunk splitting, fake trees and real trees, doomed trees and casts of trees, dead trees, trees that never lived and trees that have survived for thousands of years. Pascale Marthine Tayou\\u2019s tree bears a blossom of colourful plastic bags which rustle in the draft from the gallery\\u2019s air conditioning, while Simryn Gill\\u2019s photographs of mangroves in the Straits of Malacca focus on the plastic detritus, lost fishing gear and clothing that festoon the branches in a horrible bunting on the edge of one of the world\\u2019s busiest shipping lanes.A blossom of bags \\u2026 Pascale Marthine Tayou\\u2019s Plastic Tree B. Photograph: Oak Taylor-Smith/Courtesy of the artist and Hayward galleyThere are images of trees growing in vacant lots, of trees left standing alone as the habitat around them has been replaced by car parks, front yards and tended lawns, in a series of photographs by Robert Adams; a tree as pale and angular and bleached as the concrete wall behind it and the sky above in a painting by Gillian Carnegie; Zoe Leonard\\u2019s photographs of beleaguered New York trees growing around and through the fences and palings that contain them. All these trees, surviving against the odds.Pink blossom erupts from a straggly one before a fenced-off wasteland on a dank roadside, evoking perfectly what passes for nature in the weary edge-of-town feral hinterlands that George Shaw is so great at evoking. He captures the sense of futility and frittered time in territories marked by a blaze on a trunk, beer cans among the trodden-down leaf litter. Shaw paints the sort of non-places where people can find their pleasures or get up to no good on the margins of things. As ever, there\\u2019s no one about in his paintings, which adds to their sense of malaise. Apart from Ahtila beneath her giant spruce, there is no visible human presence in Among the Trees. But we are there, nonetheless, both as witnesses and inexorably fucking everything up. Here\\u2019s a lynching tree, photographed by Steve McQueen during the shoot for 12 Years a Slave, glowing in a lightbox. It is just a tree, venerable, old, tainted.Abel Rodr\\u00edgues and his son Wilson, from the Colombian Nonuya indigenous group, make beautiful coloured drawings evoking the Amazon forest and their knowledge of its flora and fauna, which they left for Bogot\\u00e1 in 2002. Here is one moment in the show where a sense of nature\\u2019s passing, the interconnectedness of its living landscapes, is seen with such directness and evident, deep knowledge, that it touches the heart.Among the Trees is a forest of signs. Even the gallery\\u2019s beautifully brutalist concrete walls bear the whorls and grain of the wood that was used to shutter and cast its sections. Perhaps this last provided the unconscious inspiration behind this often pleasurable and finally frustrating show of downed trunks, trees sliced into sections and reassembled, photographs of trees inverted (as though seen in a camera obscura) by Vancouver artist Rodney Graham, trees buried upside down by Robert Smithson, delicate watercolours of trees and trees only visible from certain angles, a tree carved from a log (one of several works by Giuseppe Penone), and a dense patch of forest cut by Eva Jospin from layers of corrugated cardboard. Amid this wintry tangle of trunks, branches and twigs, remnants of overgrown ruins peek from the gloom. Jospin\\u2019s work has the scale, and something of the majesty, of an arboreal rood screen. Nearby, another tangle of branches obscures Peter Doig\\u2019s 1991 The Architects Home in the Ravine, the house half hidden through frosted twigs. The quantity of accumulated details, painted touches and blips and the wandering skein of lines suck you in. I feel like a stalker in the woods, making my silent approach as I prepare a home invasion.Evoking the Amazon \\u2026 Terraza Alta II by Abel Rodr\\u00edguez. Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and Hayward galleyThe theatrical atmosphere in the Hayward\\u2019s first, double-height lower gallery is accentuated by having all the works spotlit in the semi-gloom. I am not sure this entirely works for the paintings and photographs here. Thomas Struth\\u2019s mossy rocks and fallen branches below spring foliage in Japan, and his overgrown, primeval Chinese woodland \\u2013 with, disconcertingly, cable cars floating overhead \\u2013 have enough mystery and specific, well-captured light on their own.What a puzzling exhibition Among the Trees is. Given how immediate the climate emergency is, and how little explicitly records the vast losses that both environmental changes and human greed/stupidity continue to wreak on the natural world \\u2013 which is the sole thing that might save us \\u2013 will we be left with only 3D printed trees and virtual forests? Jennifer Steinkamp\\u2019s Blind Eye is another wall-length projection, filled with a grove of animated birch trees. A breeze ruffles the branches, leaves sprout, catkins grow and fall, the foliage slowly changes colour and drops in an autumn wind. The seamless cycle, a whole year compressed into three minutes, begins again.A year in three minutes \\u2026 Jennifer Steinkamp\\u2019s Blind Eye. Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and Hayward galleyAt the end we come to Roxy Paine\\u2019s desolated, burned-down forest floor, a tabletop diorama whose blackened fibreglass stumps and fallen branches glow with an inner fire of carefully contrived red LED lights. Sadly this won\\u2019t do. It just feels like an arty revelling in destruction. I think of the novelty two-bar electric fire my parents had - in an antique-effect aluminium grate several Disney-ish fibreglass logs glowed, fitfully, from the orange lightbulbs and twirling pinwheels that hid beneath the grey and brown loglettes, affecting a thoroughly implausible simulacrum of the real log fire that had previously sputtered and crackled in the same fireplace. The exposed electric elements did more than destroy the illusion; heating the fibreglass, they caused it to emit a noxious tang of polyester resin. Perhaps a real fire might have been even more ecologically unfriendly, but I doubt it. Among the Trees is at the Hayward gallery, London from 4 March to 17 May.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Date Published\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2206,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2023-01-03\",\n          \"2019-05-11\",\n          \"2023-05-28\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

An air source heat pump running on renewable electricity will heat a home much more sustainably, which is why ministers are encouraging consumers to make the switch.\\u2018It\\u2019s been brilliant\\u2019: air source heat pump will recoup cost for ownerRead moreQ&AWhat are heat pumps and why is the UK government pushing them?ShowIn simple terms, an electric heat pump works like a reverse fridge, extracting warmth from the outside air, the ground or a nearby water source before concentrating the heat and transferring it indoors. They can usually be found outside a home, and they look like a standard air-conditioning unit.About 85% of UK homes use gas boilers for heating, making it one of the most polluting sectors of the economy. The fossil fuels used in our homes for heating, hot water and cooking make up more than a fifth of the UK\\u2019s carbon emissions, meaning low-carbon alternatives are critical if the UK government hopes to meet its climate targets.Jillian AmbrosePhotograph: KBImages/https://www.alamy.comWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.What are they and how do they work?In simple terms, an air source heat pump works like a reverse fridge, extracting warmth from the outside air before concentrating it and transferring it indoors to provide central heating and hot water. The pumps look like a standard air-conditioning unit and need to be situated outside the home. They will work at temperatures of minus 15c and lower, although the colder the outside temperature, the more electricity they need to consume to heat your home. Ground source heat pumps work in a similar way but collect the heat from pipes running underground. These are more efficient but are harder to retrofit to existing homes unless you are prepared to dig up your garden.An air source heat pump extracts warmth from the outside air before concentrating it and transferring it indoors to provide hot water and central heating. Photograph: Jenny Dettrick/Getty ImagesWhat does it cost to install one? Don\\u2019t believe some of the quoted prices that have appeared in recent days, someone with a family-size three-bed house and larger can expect to pay \\u00a38,000-\\u00a315,000 in total to install a complete air source system, while fitting out a bigger home will cost more. Alongside the pump, that price will include a new hot water tank and labour. The final bill will depend on whether your existing radiators are large enough or need to be replaced. You are also advised to upgrade your home\\u2019s insulation at the same time, which could add considerably to the final bill, depending on your home\\u2019s construction. Fitting a ground source pump will cost much more \\u2013 typically upwards of \\u00a315,000.What financial help is there?This week the government announced it will be giving households grants of \\u00a35,000 to help them install ASHPs, with the total money allocated enough to cover 90,000 homes. There will be grants of up to \\u00a36,000 available for ground source heat pumps.What has been less publicised is the fact that you can already apply for funding via the Renewable Heat IncentiveThe grants will be available from April 2022, and details of how consumers will apply are yet to be published. The scheme will operate for three years. It is highly likely that it will be oversubscribed, meaning those who can fulfil the criteria quickest will receive the grants.What has been less publicised is the fact that you can already apply for funding via the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI). Buyers have to pay for the work upfront and then reclaim the RHI payments, which are paid quarterly for the first seven years of ownership. The total paid to a household under the RHI depends on the measure installed, the home energy performance and the type and age of the boiler being replaced. Those replacing an old oil-fired boiler receive the most \\u2013 typically \\u00a39,000. If you replace an old gas boiler in a family-size house you can expect to receive a total \\u00a37,000. There is a calculator on the Gov website.To gain the RHI money you must use an MCS-accredited installer and there is a somewhat torturous application process. The RHI will close to new applications on 31 March 2022.What do air source heat pumps cost to run?People ripping out an inefficient old oil-burning boiler should reduce their annual energy bill by going for an ASHP \\u2013 but not by a huge amount. Those taking out a gas boiler are highly unlikely to see any savings and could well end up paying more each year. Octopus Energy says in a poorly insulated home it will cost as much as 40% more to run a heat pump rather than a traditional boiler. This is because the cost of electricity includes carbon taxes and subsidies to support low-carbon energy projects. Green groups have called on the government to move these levies on to gas bills instead to encourage households to turn their backs on oil and gas.Do they work as well as a conventional boiler?A properly installed ASHP system, which is the right size for the property, should keep house warm on the coldest winter days. They typically operate at 55C rather than the 60-80C that gas boilers will often work at, which is why they can require bigger radiators. They work particularly well with underfloor heating and are designed to keep indoor spaces at a steady temperature with gentle top-ups through the day.What are the downsides?Air source heat pumps will work at temperatures of minus 15c and lower, although the colder the outside temperature, the more electricity they need to consume to heat your home. Photograph: KBImages/AlamyThe biggest problem is that a great many UK homes are not suitable for an ASHP. Flat owners have struggled to get permission, and that\\u2019s assuming the installer has found a way to make a system work inside a confined space. Retrofitting a system with an existing boiler is not for the faint of heart on the basis that much of the plumbing will need to be replaced. You will also need a place to store a water tank.There have been concerns over the reliability and longevity of some systems. Mitsubishi pumps appear to be well regarded, as do those coming out of Scandinavia, and, more recently, the Northern Irish supplier, Red. Some installed in coastal towns have suffered premature wear because of the high salt content in the air.Is it worth it?If you are gutting and restoring a house and putting in a whole new heating system along with a major insulation upgrade, installing an ASHP \\u2013 or, even better, a ground source pump \\u2013 along with underfloor heating is a no-brainer. Equally, if you are currently running an old boiler that needs replacing anyway.Whether you will want to rip out a perfectly good, modern gas boiler will largely depend on how keen you are to move to zero carbon heating, the level of your home\\u2019s insulation and, if your insulation is poor, whether you are prepared to see your bills rise.Is it worth waiting for an alternative technology to emerge?Possibly. A great deal of investment is being put into community ground source heat systems, where whole roads, estates and tower blocks are plumbed into a central ground source that runs under the road. Simon Lomax, who runs Kensa Heat Pumps in Cornwall believes these offer a much better long-term solution as they are more efficient and durable, and don\\u2019t have many of the downsides of ASHPs. Hydrogen is the other great hope. Trials and schemes are testing whether the highly flammable element can be used safely.\",\n          \"On the Saturday before Labor Day, in the east Los Angeles neighborhood of Boyle Heights, temperatures outside climbed to 105F (41C).

Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty ImagesBut in this age of compounding climate emergencies, it is still unclear whether enough of this type of resilience infrastructure can be built \\u2013 and quickly enough \\u2013 to meet the needs of vulnerable communities.Beginning in 2012, Kristin Baja originated the concept of resilience centers while working as Baltimore\\u2019s climate resilience planner. She was going into neighborhoods to talk to people about emergency planning, but quickly recognized residents were not interested.At least, not as long as the local government was involved.\\u201cBaltimore has a legacy of racism and intentional discrimination,\\u201d Baja said. \\u201cIt became really clear that community members were not going to use disaster shelters because they were owned and managed by the government.\\u201dResidents also felt they had more pressing everyday concerns than when the next storm might come. High unemployment and a lack of childcare were more top of mind.To keep residents safe, solutions had to address not just weather-related hazards, but also the longstanding inequities the community faced. Baja changed course, working with residents to develop spaces that could provide backup energy, food, water and shelter \\u2013 but that would also offer after-school programs and job training.\\u201cWe\\u2019re shifting the approach from the hazard to the human,\\u201d said Baja, who is now director of direct support and innovation at the Urban Sustainability Directors Network (USDN), which helps organizations design strategies around resilience centers.By offering resources every day of the year, the center was strengthening the community\\u2019s ability to withstand disruptions, and it was building trust with residents before a crisis hit.\\u201cThey know there\\u2019s backup food, backup water, first aid,\\u201d said Baja. \\u201cThey\\u2019re much more likely to go to that space because they know they\\u2019re not going to be turned away or be treated poorly.\\u201dNot only are resilience centers more likely to be trusted by a community than government-led emergency services, they also offer a more practical and productive space to be during climate events than evacuation shelters or cooling centers.On the same Saturday that kids played Dungeons and Dragons at BHAC, only 190 people in a city of 4 million used the city\\u2019s emergency cooling centers, according to the city\\u2019s department of recreation and parks.\\u201cCooling centers are not well utilized because what you get is basically an empty gymnasium, where the temperature certainly is low, but it\\u2019s full of folding chairs and not much else,\\u201d said Chase Engelhardt, policy analyst at Climate Resolve, an advocacy group in Los Angeles.\\u201cPeople aren\\u2019t Sims,\\u201d he added, referring to the computer game. \\u201cThey won\\u2019t just go into a building, sit down for three hours and then leave once their body reaches some level of rest.\\u201dIn Boyle Heights, many residents don\\u2019t have air conditioners, or can\\u2019t afford to turn them on. To get people out of the heat, BHAC began designing programs that would attract people to the center without the stigma of needing help.Azareth Jimenez sits outside her mother\\u2019s store on Cesar E Chavez Avenue in Boyle Heights, Los Angeles. Photograph: Gabriela AounThey hosted an afternoon quilting club for elders. On Saturdays, they invited families to watch cartoons and eat cereal.BHAC recently upgraded their 100-year-old building with a hospital-grade air filtration and cooling system. They have installed air quality monitors on the building so they can alert residents when breathing conditions get dangerous. Soon, the center will have solar panels and battery storage that can provide backup power for three days. They will also have a cistern that can hold 500 gallons of potable water.The upgrades are important to ensure that BHAC can stay open in the event of a climate disruption. But the center\\u2019s best tool for keeping neighbors safe is that people enjoy being there.\\u201cWe do things that allow families to come and not have to have a pretext,\\u201d Ramirez Sanchez said. \\u201cYou can just say you came in to watch cartoons.\\u201dMost resilience centers will be born out of existing neighborhood spaces that residents are familiar with. But some communities, particularly in rural areas, may find their only option is to build centers from the ground up.Tuolumne county is about a three-hour drive south-east of Sacramento. It\\u2019s largely made up of national forest and contains northern portions of Yosemite national park. The county is a few months away from completing construction on two brand-new resilience centers. The projects have been in development since 2015.In 2013, the Rim Fire burned more than 250,000 acres in the area, destroyed 11 homes and caused evacuations that lasted weeks. \\u201cWhen Tuolumne started recovering from the Rim fire, the first thing we did was talk about what would make us more resilient as a community,\\u201d said Maureen Frank, capital projects director of Tuolumne county. \\u201cThe community wanted better response and recovery to and from emergencies, but they also wanted improved access to services.\\u201dLiving in a remote area meant that many doctor\\u2019s offices were more than 30 miles away, across winding mountain passes. Riding the bus to and from the nearest food bank took a whole day. Residents lived far from one another, and felt socially isolated. They wanted a place to gather.One of the new buildings, the Groveland Community Resilience Center, is equipped with heavy-duty heating and cooling systems, fortified with an ignition-resistant exterior, backed up by a diesel power generator, and is large enough to shelter as many as 75 people indoors at a time. But it will also provide weekly food-bank distribution, offer counseling services, and host community college classes.The resilience center also has a large outdoor amphitheater for events and a walking trail for people to meet up and socialize. \\u201cIt will be a living, breathing building, used seven days a week,\\u201d said Frank.Maureen Frank and Taylor Gold stand inside what will be the main gathering space at the Groveland Resilience Center. Photograph: Gabriela AounThe centers are scheduled to open in a few months, but as construction carried on at the Groveland Resilience Center this summer, the need was clear. On a late July morning at the construction site for the Groveland Resilience Center, the sky looked clear, but the air was thick with the smell of smoke. The Oak fire was burning in neighboring Mariposa county. It destroyed more than 60 homes and forced 6,000 people to evacuate.\\u201cIt would have been nice to have this opened,\\u201d Frank said, \\u201cso we could help.\\u201dAs resilience centers prove their effectiveness, the question becomes how many can be built, and how quickly. Developing a center can cost millions of dollars. Battery storage for microgrids is still very expensive, and some buildings need substantial upgrades before they can be outfitted with solar panels or HVAC systems.Last year, California allocated $100m toward grant programs to fund resilience center projects. But Patrick Murphy, a senior scientist at the policy institute Physicians, Scientists and Engineers for Healthy Energy (PSE), said that in proportion to the need, that is merely a drop in the bucket.Through a grant from the state, PSE is working on a mapping tool to identify which communities in California are most vulnerable to climate change, power grid vulnerabilities, health disparities and socioeconomic inequalities. They\\u2019re also aiming to identify all the possible spaces in the state where resilience hubs could be developed, including schools, community centers and churches.Murphy worries that when the study is complete, it will reveal a huge need. \\u201cOne hundred million is a good start,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut this is a multibillion-dollar problem.\\u201dIn response to concerns that interest in resilience centers far exceeded available funding, the legislature directed an additional $85m to resilience center grants in a bill that Governor Gavin Newsom signed this month.Coral Abbott, community resilience centers program manager at the California Strategic Growth Council, which will distribute the funding, said that the grants will support pilot projects in rural, urban and suburban areas. \\u201cThey will be able to serve as models that can be replicated by other communities in the future,\\u201d said Abbott.In the meantime, existing centers like BHAC are already modeling how resilience centers might allow communities to not just survive climate disruptions, but to thrive through them. When Felix\\u2019s dad, Roland, came to pick him up from the Dungeons and Dragons session, he called BHAC a \\u201clifesaver\\u201d. Playing the game made his son use critical thinking skills and offered him much-needed in-person interaction with peers.And then, of course, there was the heat. \\u201cWhen it\\u2019s hot, we try to find recreation,\\u201d the elder Felix said. \\u201cThis helps.\\u201d\",\n          \"The sixth mass extinction of wildlife on Earth is accelerating, according to an analysis by scientists who warn it may be a tipping point for the collapse of civilisation.More than 500 species of land animals were found to be on the brink of extinction and likely to be lost within 20 years. In comparison, the same number were lost over the whole of the last century. Without the human destruction of nature, even this rate of loss would have taken thousands of years, the scientists said.The land vertebrates on the verge of extinction, with fewer than 1,000 individuals left, include\\u00a0the Sumatran rhino, the Clari\\u00f3n wren, the Espa\\u00f1ola giant tortoise and the harlequin frog. Historic data was available for 77 of the species and the scientists found these had lost 94% of their populations.The researchers also warned of a domino effect, with the loss of one species tipping others that depend on it over the edge. \\u201cExtinction breeds extinctions,\\u201d they said, noting that unlike other environmental problems extinction is irreversible.Humanity relies on biodiversity for its health and wellbeing, scientists said, with the coronavirus pandemic an extreme example of the dangers of ravaging the natural world. Rising human population, destruction of habitats, the wildlife trade, pollution and the climate crisis must all be urgently tackled, they said.Human society under urgent threat from loss of Earth's natural lifeRead more\\u201cWhen humanity exterminates other creatures, it is sawing off the limb on which it is sitting, destroying working parts of our own life-support system,\\u201d said Prof Paul Ehrlich, of Stanford University in the US, and one of the research team. \\u201cThe conservation of endangered species should be elevated to a global emergency for governments and institutions, equal to the climate disruption to which it is linked.\\u201dHarlequin frog. Photograph: Gerardo Ceballos/University of Mexico/PA\\u201cWe are facing our final opportunity to ensure that the many services nature provides us do not get irretrievably sabotaged,\\u201d said Prof Gerardo Ceballos of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, who led the research.\\u00a0The analysis, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, examined data on 29,400 land vertebrate species compiled by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and BirdLife International. The researchers identified 515 species with populations below 1,000 and about half of these had fewer than 250 remaining. Most of these mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians were found in tropical and subtropical regions.Scientists discovered that 388 species of land vertebrate had populations under 5,000, and the vast majority (84%) lived in the same regions as the species with populations under 1,000, creating the conditions for a domino effect.Known examples of this include the overhunting of sea otters, the main predator of kelp-eating sea urchins. A boom in urchins devastated kelp forests in the Bering Sea, leading to the extinction of the kelp-eating Steller\\u2019s sea cow.UN draft plan sets 2030 target to avert Earth's sixth mass extinctionRead moreThe researchers said their findings could aid conservation efforts by highlighting the species and regions requiring the most urgent attention.\\u00a0Prof Andy Purvis, at the Natural History Museum in London, and not part of the new analysis, said:\\u00a0\\u201cThis research provides another line of evidence that the biodiversity crisis is accelerating. The hardest problem [the researchers] faced is that we don\\u2019t know more about the history of species\\u2019 geographic distributions. They only had that information for 77 of the species on the brink, and we can\\u2019t know for sure how typical those species are.\\u201d\\u00a0Espa\\u00f1ola giant tortoise. Photograph: Gerardo Ceballos/University of Mexico/PA\\u201cBut that doesn\\u2019t undermine the conclusion,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe biodiversity crisis is real and urgent. But \\u2013 and this is the crucial point \\u2013 it is not too late. To transition to a sustainable world, we need to tread more lightly on the planet. Until then, we are essentially robbing future generations of their inheritance.\\u201d\\u00a0What is biodiversity and why does it matter to us?Read moreProf Georgina Mace, of University College London, said: \\u201cThis new analysis re-emphasises some startling facts about the extent to which vertebrate populations have been reduced worldwide by human activities.\\u201d But she said she was not convinced that simply having a population less than 1,000 was the best measure of a species being on the brink. A declining trend for the population is also important and both factors are used in the IUCN Red List, she said.\\u201cAction is important for many reasons, not least of which is that directly and indirectly we rely on the rest of life on Earth for our own health and wellbeing,\\u201d she said. \\u201cDisrupting nature leads to costly and often hard-to-reverse effects. Covid-19 is an extreme present-day example, but there are many more.\\u201dMark Wright, the director of science at WWF, said: \\u201cThe numbers in this research are shocking. However, there is still hope. If we stop the land-grabbing and devastating deforestation in countries such as Brazil, we can start to bend the curve in biodiversity loss and climate change. But we need global ambition to do that.\\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Date Published\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2207,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2020-06-26\",\n          \"2019-11-28\",\n          \"2019-06-10\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

An air source heat pump running on renewable electricity will heat a home much more sustainably, which is why ministers are encouraging consumers to make the switch.\\u2018It\\u2019s been brilliant\\u2019: air source heat pump will recoup cost for ownerRead moreQ&AWhat are heat pumps and why is the UK government pushing them?ShowIn simple terms, an electric heat pump works like a reverse fridge, extracting warmth from the outside air, the ground or a nearby water source before concentrating the heat and transferring it indoors. They can usually be found outside a home, and they look like a standard air-conditioning unit.About 85% of UK homes use gas boilers for heating, making it one of the most polluting sectors of the economy. The fossil fuels used in our homes for heating, hot water and cooking make up more than a fifth of the UK\\u2019s carbon emissions, meaning low-carbon alternatives are critical if the UK government hopes to meet its climate targets.Jillian AmbrosePhotograph: KBImages/https://www.alamy.comWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.What are they and how do they work?In simple terms, an air source heat pump works like a reverse fridge, extracting warmth from the outside air before concentrating it and transferring it indoors to provide central heating and hot water. The pumps look like a standard air-conditioning unit and need to be situated outside the home. They will work at temperatures of minus 15c and lower, although the colder the outside temperature, the more electricity they need to consume to heat your home. Ground source heat pumps work in a similar way but collect the heat from pipes running underground. These are more efficient but are harder to retrofit to existing homes unless you are prepared to dig up your garden.An air source heat pump extracts warmth from the outside air before concentrating it and transferring it indoors to provide hot water and central heating. Photograph: Jenny Dettrick/Getty ImagesWhat does it cost to install one? Don\\u2019t believe some of the quoted prices that have appeared in recent days, someone with a family-size three-bed house and larger can expect to pay \\u00a38,000-\\u00a315,000 in total to install a complete air source system, while fitting out a bigger home will cost more. Alongside the pump, that price will include a new hot water tank and labour. The final bill will depend on whether your existing radiators are large enough or need to be replaced. You are also advised to upgrade your home\\u2019s insulation at the same time, which could add considerably to the final bill, depending on your home\\u2019s construction. Fitting a ground source pump will cost much more \\u2013 typically upwards of \\u00a315,000.What financial help is there?This week the government announced it will be giving households grants of \\u00a35,000 to help them install ASHPs, with the total money allocated enough to cover 90,000 homes. There will be grants of up to \\u00a36,000 available for ground source heat pumps.What has been less publicised is the fact that you can already apply for funding via the Renewable Heat IncentiveThe grants will be available from April 2022, and details of how consumers will apply are yet to be published. The scheme will operate for three years. It is highly likely that it will be oversubscribed, meaning those who can fulfil the criteria quickest will receive the grants.What has been less publicised is the fact that you can already apply for funding via the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI). Buyers have to pay for the work upfront and then reclaim the RHI payments, which are paid quarterly for the first seven years of ownership. The total paid to a household under the RHI depends on the measure installed, the home energy performance and the type and age of the boiler being replaced. Those replacing an old oil-fired boiler receive the most \\u2013 typically \\u00a39,000. If you replace an old gas boiler in a family-size house you can expect to receive a total \\u00a37,000. There is a calculator on the Gov website.To gain the RHI money you must use an MCS-accredited installer and there is a somewhat torturous application process. The RHI will close to new applications on 31 March 2022.What do air source heat pumps cost to run?People ripping out an inefficient old oil-burning boiler should reduce their annual energy bill by going for an ASHP \\u2013 but not by a huge amount. Those taking out a gas boiler are highly unlikely to see any savings and could well end up paying more each year. Octopus Energy says in a poorly insulated home it will cost as much as 40% more to run a heat pump rather than a traditional boiler. This is because the cost of electricity includes carbon taxes and subsidies to support low-carbon energy projects. Green groups have called on the government to move these levies on to gas bills instead to encourage households to turn their backs on oil and gas.Do they work as well as a conventional boiler?A properly installed ASHP system, which is the right size for the property, should keep house warm on the coldest winter days. They typically operate at 55C rather than the 60-80C that gas boilers will often work at, which is why they can require bigger radiators. They work particularly well with underfloor heating and are designed to keep indoor spaces at a steady temperature with gentle top-ups through the day.What are the downsides?Air source heat pumps will work at temperatures of minus 15c and lower, although the colder the outside temperature, the more electricity they need to consume to heat your home. Photograph: KBImages/AlamyThe biggest problem is that a great many UK homes are not suitable for an ASHP. Flat owners have struggled to get permission, and that\\u2019s assuming the installer has found a way to make a system work inside a confined space. Retrofitting a system with an existing boiler is not for the faint of heart on the basis that much of the plumbing will need to be replaced. You will also need a place to store a water tank.There have been concerns over the reliability and longevity of some systems. Mitsubishi pumps appear to be well regarded, as do those coming out of Scandinavia, and, more recently, the Northern Irish supplier, Red. Some installed in coastal towns have suffered premature wear because of the high salt content in the air.Is it worth it?If you are gutting and restoring a house and putting in a whole new heating system along with a major insulation upgrade, installing an ASHP \\u2013 or, even better, a ground source pump \\u2013 along with underfloor heating is a no-brainer. Equally, if you are currently running an old boiler that needs replacing anyway.Whether you will want to rip out a perfectly good, modern gas boiler will largely depend on how keen you are to move to zero carbon heating, the level of your home\\u2019s insulation and, if your insulation is poor, whether you are prepared to see your bills rise.Is it worth waiting for an alternative technology to emerge?Possibly. A great deal of investment is being put into community ground source heat systems, where whole roads, estates and tower blocks are plumbed into a central ground source that runs under the road. Simon Lomax, who runs Kensa Heat Pumps in Cornwall believes these offer a much better long-term solution as they are more efficient and durable, and don\\u2019t have many of the downsides of ASHPs. Hydrogen is the other great hope. Trials and schemes are testing whether the highly flammable element can be used safely.\",\n          \"On the Saturday before Labor Day, in the east Los Angeles neighborhood of Boyle Heights, temperatures outside climbed to 105F (41C). It was the fourth day of California\\u2019s longest September heatwave on record. That afternoon, the entire state was under a \\u201cflex alert\\u201d, in which Californians were asked to turn down their air conditioners and unplug appliances to avoid putting so much demand on the power grid that utilities would have to intermittently cut electricity.\\u2018Transformational\\u2019: could America\\u2019s new green bank be a climate gamechanger?Read moreBut at the Boyle Heights Arts Conservatory, or BHAC, children sat around a table engrossed in the role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons. The thermostat read a cool 72F.As a chaperone set down pizza lunches, Leo Felix, 11, surveyed his figurines and strategized his next move. When asked what he would be doing on a hot day like this if he weren\\u2019t at the BHAC, Felix shrugged. \\u201cI\\u2019d probably be outside, trying not to die from heat.\\u201dBHAC is a career training center that has been preparing young people for jobs in media arts for 11 years. But recently, BHAC has been taking on a new role in its community \\u2013 shielding some of east Los Angeles\\u2019s most vulnerable residents from extreme weather.The conservatory is an example of what is known in California and beyond as a \\u201cresilience center\\u201d \\u2013 a community space built to withstand climate disruptions like storms and power outages, but that also builds long-term preparedness by offering programs that improve people\\u2019s social, physical and economic health so they can withstand crises. Community members have found that temporary, reactive disaster responses like emergency shelters don\\u2019t adequately protect residents, and that, especially in disadvantaged communities, climate resilience must also address pre-existing inequities.As hazards like wildfire smoke, extreme heat and power outages last longer and happen more often, more communities across California are turning to these centers for support, and the state has committed nearly $200m in funding to developing more.A pedestrian uses an umbrella in the heat in Rosemead, California. Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty ImagesBut in this age of compounding climate emergencies, it is still unclear whether enough of this type of resilience infrastructure can be built \\u2013 and quickly enough \\u2013 to meet the needs of vulnerable communities.Beginning in 2012, Kristin Baja originated the concept of resilience centers while working as Baltimore\\u2019s climate resilience planner. She was going into neighborhoods to talk to people about emergency planning, but quickly recognized residents were not interested.At least, not as long as the local government was involved.\\u201cBaltimore has a legacy of racism and intentional discrimination,\\u201d Baja said. \\u201cIt became really clear that community members were not going to use disaster shelters because they were owned and managed by the government.\\u201dResidents also felt they had more pressing everyday concerns than when the next storm might come. High unemployment and a lack of childcare were more top of mind.To keep residents safe, solutions had to address not just weather-related hazards, but also the longstanding inequities the community faced. Baja changed course, working with residents to develop spaces that could provide backup energy, food, water and shelter \\u2013 but that would also offer after-school programs and job training.\\u201cWe\\u2019re shifting the approach from the hazard to the human,\\u201d said Baja, who is now director of direct support and innovation at the Urban Sustainability Directors Network (USDN), which helps organizations design strategies around resilience centers.By offering resources every day of the year, the center was strengthening the community\\u2019s ability to withstand disruptions, and it was building trust with residents before a crisis hit.\\u201cThey know there\\u2019s backup food, backup water, first aid,\\u201d said Baja. \\u201cThey\\u2019re much more likely to go to that space because they know they\\u2019re not going to be turned away or be treated poorly.\\u201dNot only are resilience centers more likely to be trusted by a community than government-led emergency services, they also offer a more practical and productive space to be during climate events than evacuation shelters or cooling centers.On the same Saturday that kids played Dungeons and Dragons at BHAC, only 190 people in a city of 4 million used the city\\u2019s emergency cooling centers, according to the city\\u2019s department of recreation and parks.\\u201cCooling centers are not well utilized because what you get is basically an empty gymnasium, where the temperature certainly is low, but it\\u2019s full of folding chairs and not much else,\\u201d said Chase Engelhardt, policy analyst at Climate Resolve, an advocacy group in Los Angeles.\\u201cPeople aren\\u2019t Sims,\\u201d he added, referring to the computer game. \\u201cThey won\\u2019t just go into a building, sit down for three hours and then leave once their body reaches some level of rest.\\u201dIn Boyle Heights, many residents don\\u2019t have air conditioners, or can\\u2019t afford to turn them on. To get people out of the heat, BHAC began designing programs that would attract people to the center without the stigma of needing help.Azareth Jimenez sits outside her mother\\u2019s store on Cesar E Chavez Avenue in Boyle Heights, Los Angeles. Photograph: Gabriela AounThey hosted an afternoon quilting club for elders. On Saturdays, they invited families to watch cartoons and eat cereal.BHAC recently upgraded their 100-year-old building with a hospital-grade air filtration and cooling system. They have installed air quality monitors on the building so they can alert residents when breathing conditions get dangerous. Soon, the center will have solar panels and battery storage that can provide backup power for three days. They will also have a cistern that can hold 500 gallons of potable water.The upgrades are important to ensure that BHAC can stay open in the event of a climate disruption. But the center\\u2019s best tool for keeping neighbors safe is that people enjoy being there.\\u201cWe do things that allow families to come and not have to have a pretext,\\u201d Ramirez Sanchez said. \\u201cYou can just say you came in to watch cartoons.\\u201dMost resilience centers will be born out of existing neighborhood spaces that residents are familiar with. But some communities, particularly in rural areas, may find their only option is to build centers from the ground up.Tuolumne county is about a three-hour drive south-east of Sacramento. It\\u2019s largely made up of national forest and contains northern portions of Yosemite national park. The county is a few months away from completing construction on two brand-new resilience centers. The projects have been in development since 2015.In 2013, the Rim Fire burned more than 250,000 acres in the area, destroyed 11 homes and caused evacuations that lasted weeks. \\u201cWhen Tuolumne started recovering from the Rim fire, the first thing we did was talk about what would make us more resilient as a community,\\u201d said Maureen Frank, capital projects director of Tuolumne county. \\u201cThe community wanted better response and recovery to and from emergencies, but they also wanted improved access to services.\\u201dLiving in a remote area meant that many doctor\\u2019s offices were more than 30 miles away, across winding mountain passes. Riding the bus to and from the nearest food bank took a whole day. Residents lived far from one another, and felt socially isolated. They wanted a place to gather.One of the new buildings, the Groveland Community Resilience Center, is equipped with heavy-duty heating and cooling systems, fortified with an ignition-resistant exterior, backed up by a diesel power generator, and is large enough to shelter as many as 75 people indoors at a time. But it will also provide weekly food-bank distribution, offer counseling services, and host community college classes.The resilience center also has a large outdoor amphitheater for events and a walking trail for people to meet up and socialize. \\u201cIt will be a living, breathing building, used seven days a week,\\u201d said Frank.Maureen Frank and Taylor Gold stand inside what will be the main gathering space at the Groveland Resilience Center. Photograph: Gabriela AounThe centers are scheduled to open in a few months, but as construction carried on at the Groveland Resilience Center this summer, the need was clear. On a late July morning at the construction site for the Groveland Resilience Center, the sky looked clear, but the air was thick with the smell of smoke. The Oak fire was burning in neighboring Mariposa county. It destroyed more than 60 homes and forced 6,000 people to evacuate.\\u201cIt would have been nice to have this opened,\\u201d Frank said, \\u201cso we could help.\\u201dAs resilience centers prove their effectiveness, the question becomes how many can be built, and how quickly. Developing a center can cost millions of dollars. Battery storage for microgrids is still very expensive, and some buildings need substantial upgrades before they can be outfitted with solar panels or HVAC systems.Last year, California allocated $100m toward grant programs to fund resilience center projects. But Patrick Murphy, a senior scientist at the policy institute Physicians, Scientists and Engineers for Healthy Energy (PSE), said that in proportion to the need, that is merely a drop in the bucket.Through a grant from the state, PSE is working on a mapping tool to identify which communities in California are most vulnerable to climate change, power grid vulnerabilities, health disparities and socioeconomic inequalities. They\\u2019re also aiming to identify all the possible spaces in the state where resilience hubs could be developed, including schools, community centers and churches.Murphy worries that when the study is complete, it will reveal a huge need. \\u201cOne hundred million is a good start,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut this is a multibillion-dollar problem.\\u201dIn response to concerns that interest in resilience centers far exceeded available funding, the legislature directed an additional $85m to resilience center grants in a bill that Governor Gavin Newsom signed this month.Coral Abbott, community resilience centers program manager at the California Strategic Growth Council, which will distribute the funding, said that the grants will support pilot projects in rural, urban and suburban areas. \\u201cThey will be able to serve as models that can be replicated by other communities in the future,\\u201d said Abbott.In the meantime, existing centers like BHAC are already modeling how resilience centers might allow communities to not just survive climate disruptions, but to thrive through them. When Felix\\u2019s dad, Roland, came to pick him up from the Dungeons and Dragons session, he called BHAC a \\u201clifesaver\\u201d. Playing the game made his son use critical thinking skills and offered him much-needed in-person interaction with peers.And then, of course, there was the heat. \\u201cWhen it\\u2019s hot, we try to find recreation,\\u201d the elder Felix said. \\u201cThis helps.\\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Date Published\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2207,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2020-06-26\",\n          \"2019-11-28\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

An air source heat pump running on renewable electricity will heat a home much more sustainably, which is why ministers are encouraging consumers to make the switch.\\u2018It\\u2019s been brilliant\\u2019: air source heat pump will recoup cost for ownerRead moreQ&AWhat are heat pumps and why is the UK government pushing them?ShowIn simple terms, an electric heat pump works like a reverse fridge, extracting warmth from the outside air, the ground or a nearby water source before concentrating the heat and transferring it indoors. They can usually be found outside a home, and they look like a standard air-conditioning unit.About 85% of UK homes use gas boilers for heating, making it one of the most polluting sectors of the economy. The fossil fuels used in our homes for heating, hot water and cooking make up more than a fifth of the UK\\u2019s carbon emissions, meaning low-carbon alternatives are critical if the UK government hopes to meet its climate targets.Jillian AmbrosePhotograph: KBImages/https://www.alamy.comWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.What are they and how do they work?In simple terms, an air source heat pump works like a reverse fridge, extracting warmth from the outside air before concentrating it and transferring it indoors to provide central heating and hot water. The pumps look like a standard air-conditioning unit and need to be situated outside the home. They will work at temperatures of minus 15c and lower, although the colder the outside temperature, the more electricity they need to consume to heat your home. Ground source heat pumps work in a similar way but collect the heat from pipes running underground. These are more efficient but are harder to retrofit to existing homes unless you are prepared to dig up your garden.An air source heat pump extracts warmth from the outside air before concentrating it and transferring it indoors to provide hot water and central heating. Photograph: Jenny Dettrick/Getty ImagesWhat does it cost to install one? Don\\u2019t believe some of the quoted prices that have appeared in recent days, someone with a family-size three-bed house and larger can expect to pay \\u00a38,000-\\u00a315,000 in total to install a complete air source system, while fitting out a bigger home will cost more. Alongside the pump, that price will include a new hot water tank and labour. The final bill will depend on whether your existing radiators are large enough or need to be replaced. You are also advised to upgrade your home\\u2019s insulation at the same time, which could add considerably to the final bill, depending on your home\\u2019s construction. Fitting a ground source pump will cost much more \\u2013 typically upwards of \\u00a315,000.What financial help is there?This week the government announced it will be giving households grants of \\u00a35,000 to help them install ASHPs, with the total money allocated enough to cover 90,000 homes. There will be grants of up to \\u00a36,000 available for ground source heat pumps.What has been less publicised is the fact that you can already apply for funding via the Renewable Heat IncentiveThe grants will be available from April 2022, and details of how consumers will apply are yet to be published. The scheme will operate for three years. It is highly likely that it will be oversubscribed, meaning those who can fulfil the criteria quickest will receive the grants.What has been less publicised is the fact that you can already apply for funding via the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI). Buyers have to pay for the work upfront and then reclaim the RHI payments, which are paid quarterly for the first seven years of ownership. The total paid to a household under the RHI depends on the measure installed, the home energy performance and the type and age of the boiler being replaced. Those replacing an old oil-fired boiler receive the most \\u2013 typically \\u00a39,000. If you replace an old gas boiler in a family-size house you can expect to receive a total \\u00a37,000. There is a calculator on the Gov website.To gain the RHI money you must use an MCS-accredited installer and there is a somewhat torturous application process.

Those taking out a gas boiler are highly unlikely to see any savings and could well end up paying more each year. Octopus Energy says in a poorly insulated home it will cost as much as 40% more to run a heat pump rather than a traditional boiler. This is because the cost of electricity includes carbon taxes and subsidies to support low-carbon energy projects. Green groups have called on the government to move these levies on to gas bills instead to encourage households to turn their backs on oil and gas.Do they work as well as a conventional boiler?A properly installed ASHP system, which is the right size for the property, should keep house warm on the coldest winter days. They typically operate at 55C rather than the 60-80C that gas boilers will often work at, which is why they can require bigger radiators. They work particularly well with underfloor heating and are designed to keep indoor spaces at a steady temperature with gentle top-ups through the day.What are the downsides?Air source heat pumps will work at temperatures of minus 15c and lower, although the colder the outside temperature, the more electricity they need to consume to heat your home. Photograph: KBImages/AlamyThe biggest problem is that a great many UK homes are not suitable for an ASHP. Flat owners have struggled to get permission, and that\\u2019s assuming the installer has found a way to make a system work inside a confined space. Retrofitting a system with an existing boiler is not for the faint of heart on the basis that much of the plumbing will need to be replaced. You will also need a place to store a water tank.There have been concerns over the reliability and longevity of some systems. Mitsubishi pumps appear to be well regarded, as do those coming out of Scandinavia, and, more recently, the Northern Irish supplier, Red. Some installed in coastal towns have suffered premature wear because of the high salt content in the air.Is it worth it?If you are gutting and restoring a house and putting in a whole new heating system along with a major insulation upgrade, installing an ASHP \\u2013 or, even better, a ground source pump \\u2013 along with underfloor heating is a no-brainer. Equally, if you are currently running an old boiler that needs replacing anyway.Whether you will want to rip out a perfectly good, modern gas boiler will largely depend on how keen you are to move to zero carbon heating, the level of your home\\u2019s insulation and, if your insulation is poor, whether you are prepared to see your bills rise.Is it worth waiting for an alternative technology to emerge?Possibly. A great deal of investment is being put into community ground source heat systems, where whole roads, estates and tower blocks are plumbed into a central ground source that runs under the road. Simon Lomax, who runs Kensa Heat Pumps in Cornwall believes these offer a much better long-term solution as they are more efficient and durable, and don\\u2019t have many of the downsides of ASHPs. Hydrogen is the other great hope. Trials and schemes are testing whether the highly flammable element can be used safely.\",\n          \"On the Saturday before Labor Day, in the east Los Angeles neighborhood of Boyle Heights, temperatures outside climbed to 105F (41C). It was the fourth day of California\\u2019s longest September heatwave on record. That afternoon, the entire state was under a \\u201cflex alert\\u201d, in which Californians were asked to turn down their air conditioners and unplug appliances to avoid putting so much demand on the power grid that utilities would have to intermittently cut electricity.\\u2018Transformational\\u2019: could America\\u2019s new green bank be a climate gamechanger?Read moreBut at the Boyle Heights Arts Conservatory, or BHAC, children sat around a table engrossed in the role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons. The thermostat read a cool 72F.As a chaperone set down pizza lunches, Leo Felix, 11, surveyed his figurines and strategized his next move. When asked what he would be doing on a hot day like this if he weren\\u2019t at the BHAC, Felix shrugged. \\u201cI\\u2019d probably be outside, trying not to die from heat.\\u201dBHAC is a career training center that has been preparing young people for jobs in media arts for 11 years. But recently, BHAC has been taking on a new role in its community \\u2013 shielding some of east Los Angeles\\u2019s most vulnerable residents from extreme weather.The conservatory is an example of what is known in California and beyond as a \\u201cresilience center\\u201d \\u2013 a community space built to withstand climate disruptions like storms and power outages, but that also builds long-term preparedness by offering programs that improve people\\u2019s social, physical and economic health so they can withstand crises. Community members have found that temporary, reactive disaster responses like emergency shelters don\\u2019t adequately protect residents, and that, especially in disadvantaged communities, climate resilience must also address pre-existing inequities.As hazards like wildfire smoke, extreme heat and power outages last longer and happen more often, more communities across California are turning to these centers for support, and the state has committed nearly $200m in funding to developing more.A pedestrian uses an umbrella in the heat in Rosemead, California. Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty ImagesBut in this age of compounding climate emergencies, it is still unclear whether enough of this type of resilience infrastructure can be built \\u2013 and quickly enough \\u2013 to meet the needs of vulnerable communities.Beginning in 2012, Kristin Baja originated the concept of resilience centers while working as Baltimore\\u2019s climate resilience planner. She was going into neighborhoods to talk to people about emergency planning, but quickly recognized residents were not interested.At least, not as long as the local government was involved.\\u201cBaltimore has a legacy of racism and intentional discrimination,\\u201d Baja said. \\u201cIt became really clear that community members were not going to use disaster shelters because they were owned and managed by the government.\\u201dResidents also felt they had more pressing everyday concerns than when the next storm might come. High unemployment and a lack of childcare were more top of mind.To keep residents safe, solutions had to address not just weather-related hazards, but also the longstanding inequities the community faced. Baja changed course, working with residents to develop spaces that could provide backup energy, food, water and shelter \\u2013 but that would also offer after-school programs and job training.\\u201cWe\\u2019re shifting the approach from the hazard to the human,\\u201d said Baja, who is now director of direct support and innovation at the Urban Sustainability Directors Network (USDN), which helps organizations design strategies around resilience centers.By offering resources every day of the year, the center was strengthening the community\\u2019s ability to withstand disruptions, and it was building trust with residents before a crisis hit.\\u201cThey know there\\u2019s backup food, backup water, first aid,\\u201d said Baja. \\u201cThey\\u2019re much more likely to go to that space because they know they\\u2019re not going to be turned away or be treated poorly.\\u201dNot only are resilience centers more likely to be trusted by a community than government-led emergency services, they also offer a more practical and productive space to be during climate events than evacuation shelters or cooling centers.On the same Saturday that kids played Dungeons and Dragons at BHAC, only 190 people in a city of 4 million used the city\\u2019s emergency cooling centers, according to the city\\u2019s department of recreation and parks.\\u201cCooling centers are not well utilized because what you get is basically an empty gymnasium, where the temperature certainly is low, but it\\u2019s full of folding chairs and not much else,\\u201d said Chase Engelhardt, policy analyst at Climate Resolve, an advocacy group in Los Angeles.\\u201cPeople aren\\u2019t Sims,\\u201d he added, referring to the computer game. \\u201cThey won\\u2019t just go into a building, sit down for three hours and then leave once their body reaches some level of rest.\\u201dIn Boyle Heights, many residents don\\u2019t have air conditioners, or can\\u2019t afford to turn them on. To get people out of the heat, BHAC began designing programs that would attract people to the center without the stigma of needing help.Azareth Jimenez sits outside her mother\\u2019s store on Cesar E Chavez Avenue in Boyle Heights, Los Angeles. Photograph: Gabriela AounThey hosted an afternoon quilting club for elders. On Saturdays, they invited families to watch cartoons and eat cereal.BHAC recently upgraded their 100-year-old building with a hospital-grade air filtration and cooling system. They have installed air quality monitors on the building so they can alert residents when breathing conditions get dangerous. Soon, the center will have solar panels and battery storage that can provide backup power for three days. They will also have a cistern that can hold 500 gallons of potable water.The upgrades are important to ensure that BHAC can stay open in the event of a climate disruption. But the center\\u2019s best tool for keeping neighbors safe is that people enjoy being there.\\u201cWe do things that allow families to come and not have to have a pretext,\\u201d Ramirez Sanchez said. \\u201cYou can just say you came in to watch cartoons.\\u201dMost resilience centers will be born out of existing neighborhood spaces that residents are familiar with. But some communities, particularly in rural areas, may find their only option is to build centers from the ground up.Tuolumne county is about a three-hour drive south-east of Sacramento. It\\u2019s largely made up of national forest and contains northern portions of Yosemite national park. The county is a few months away from completing construction on two brand-new resilience centers. The projects have been in development since 2015.In 2013, the Rim Fire burned more than 250,000 acres in the area, destroyed 11 homes and caused evacuations that lasted weeks. \\u201cWhen Tuolumne started recovering from the Rim fire, the first thing we did was talk about what would make us more resilient as a community,\\u201d said Maureen Frank, capital projects director of Tuolumne county. \\u201cThe community wanted better response and recovery to and from emergencies, but they also wanted improved access to services.\\u201dLiving in a remote area meant that many doctor\\u2019s offices were more than 30 miles away, across winding mountain passes. Riding the bus to and from the nearest food bank took a whole day. Residents lived far from one another, and felt socially isolated. They wanted a place to gather.One of the new buildings, the Groveland Community Resilience Center, is equipped with heavy-duty heating and cooling systems, fortified with an ignition-resistant exterior, backed up by a diesel power generator, and is large enough to shelter as many as 75 people indoors at a time. But it will also provide weekly food-bank distribution, offer counseling services, and host community college classes.The resilience center also has a large outdoor amphitheater for events and a walking trail for people to meet up and socialize. \\u201cIt will be a living, breathing building, used seven days a week,\\u201d said Frank.Maureen Frank and Taylor Gold stand inside what will be the main gathering space at the Groveland Resilience Center. Photograph: Gabriela AounThe centers are scheduled to open in a few months, but as construction carried on at the Groveland Resilience Center this summer, the need was clear. On a late July morning at the construction site for the Groveland Resilience Center, the sky looked clear, but the air was thick with the smell of smoke. The Oak fire was burning in neighboring Mariposa county. It destroyed more than 60 homes and forced 6,000 people to evacuate.\\u201cIt would have been nice to have this opened,\\u201d Frank said, \\u201cso we could help.\\u201dAs resilience centers prove their effectiveness, the question becomes how many can be built, and how quickly. Developing a center can cost millions of dollars. Battery storage for microgrids is still very expensive, and some buildings need substantial upgrades before they can be outfitted with solar panels or HVAC systems.Last year, California allocated $100m toward grant programs to fund resilience center projects. But Patrick Murphy, a senior scientist at the policy institute Physicians, Scientists and Engineers for Healthy Energy (PSE), said that in proportion to the need, that is merely a drop in the bucket.Through a grant from the state, PSE is working on a mapping tool to identify which communities in California are most vulnerable to climate change, power grid vulnerabilities, health disparities and socioeconomic inequalities. They\\u2019re also aiming to identify all the possible spaces in the state where resilience hubs could be developed, including schools, community centers and churches.Murphy worries that when the study is complete, it will reveal a huge need. \\u201cOne hundred million is a good start,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut this is a multibillion-dollar problem.\\u201dIn response to concerns that interest in resilience centers far exceeded available funding, the legislature directed an additional $85m to resilience center grants in a bill that Governor Gavin Newsom signed this month.Coral Abbott, community resilience centers program manager at the California Strategic Growth Council, which will distribute the funding, said that the grants will support pilot projects in rural, urban and suburban areas. \\u201cThey will be able to serve as models that can be replicated by other communities in the future,\\u201d said Abbott.In the meantime, existing centers like BHAC are already modeling how resilience centers might allow communities to not just survive climate disruptions, but to thrive through them. When Felix\\u2019s dad, Roland, came to pick him up from the Dungeons and Dragons session, he called BHAC a \\u201clifesaver\\u201d. Playing the game made his son use critical thinking skills and offered him much-needed in-person interaction with peers.And then, of course, there was the heat. \\u201cWhen it\\u2019s hot, we try to find recreation,\\u201d the elder Felix said. \\u201cThis helps.\\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Date Published\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2207,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2020-06-26\",\n          \"2019-11-28\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The mission he was discussing with the Egyptian government was more earthbound in nature, but every bit as ambitious. It could even represent a giant leap for mankind.Van der Hoeven is a co-founder of the Weather Makers, a Dutch firm of \\u201cholistic engineers\\u201d with a plan to regreen the Sinai peninsula \\u2013 the small triangle of land that connects Egypt to Asia. Within a couple of decades, the Weather Makers believe, the Sinai could be transformed from a hot, dry, barren desert into a green haven teeming with life: forests, wetlands, farming land, wild flora and fauna. A regreened Sinai would alter local weather patterns and even change the direction of the winds, bringing more rain, the Weather Makers believe \\u2013 hence their name.\\u201cIf anybody doubts that the Sinai can be regreened,\\u201d Van der Hoeven told the Egyptian delegates, an assortment of academics, representatives of ministers and military top brass, \\u201cthen you have to understand that landing on the moon was once thought unrealistic. They didn\\u2019t lay out a full, detailed roadmap when they started, but they had the vision. And step by step they made it happen.\\u201dVan der Hoeven is nothing if not persuasive. Voluble, energetic and down-to-earth, the 40-year-old engineer\\u2019s train of thought runs through disciplines from morphology to esoteric mysticism, often threatening to jump the tracks. But he is keenly focused on the future. \\u201cThis world is ready for regenerative change,\\u201d he says. \\u201cIt\\u2019s going to be a complete change of our behaviour as a species in the longer term. It is going to be a step as big as fire was for humanity.\\u201dIt became clear we had a massive opportunity. It wasn\\u2019t the solution to one problem; it was the solution to all the problemsIt sounds impossibly far-fetched, but not only is the Weather Makers\\u2019 plan perfectly feasible, they insist, it is precisely the type of project humanity should be getting its head around right now. In recent years, discussion about the climate crisis has predominantly focused on fossil fuels and greenhouse gases; now, we\\u2019re coming to realise that the other side of that coin is protecting and replenishing the natural world. There is no better mechanism for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than nature, but in the past 5,000 years, human activity has reduced the Earth\\u2019s total biomass by an estimated 50%, and destroyed or degraded 70% of the world\\u2019s forests. As UN secretary general Ant\\u00f3nio Guterres put it last year: \\u201cHuman activities are at the root of our descent toward chaos. But that means human action can help to solve it.\\u201dThe Weather Makers know this very well: their origins are in dredging, one of the heaviest industries there is. Over the past few centuries, dredging has helped humans alter the face of the planet on ever-greater scales. Trained as a morphological engineer, Van der Hoeven has spent the past decade in the industry, working on projects across the world, including the artificial islands of Dubai, whose creation involved large-scale dredging and land reclamation. He got sucked into the expat lifestyle there, he admits: drinking, eating, partying, \\u201cI lost a little bit of my soul.\\u201d Returning to the Netherlands in 2008, he began to reexamine his own profession: \\u201cWhat I could see is that the dredging industry had so much potential; we were just misusing it.\\u201dWorking for the Belgian company Deme, he devised a new method of dredging that was both more eco-friendly and more efficient. He used inexpensive sensors to model maritime conditions in real time \\u2013 waves, currents, tides \\u2013 so as to determine more precisely where and when it was safe to work. Trialling the system, he won over sceptical colleagues by living on the vessel with them, even cooking meals. Head office was also convinced when his technique saved a small fortune.In January 2016, Van der Hoeven was contacted by Deme\\u2019s Egyptian representative, Malik Boukebbous, who had been asked by the Egyptian government to look into restoring Lake Bardawil, a lagoon on the north coast of the Sinai. The lake was once 20 to 40 metres deep, but today is just a few metres deep. Dredging the lake and cutting channels to allow more water in from the Mediterranean would make it deeper, cooler and less salty \\u2013 all of which would boost fish stocks.But Van der Hoeven did not want to stop there. \\u201cIf I feel I\\u2019m on the right track, it\\u2019s difficult for people to distract me,\\u201d he says. He began looking at the Sinai peninsula in more detail: its history, weather patterns, geology, tides, plant and animal life, even religious texts. He took himself off other projects and spent long hours in his apartment surrounded by charts, maps, books, sketched diagrams. \\u201cPeople were afraid for me because I was forgetting myself. My friends were cooking for me.\\u201d The deeper he looked, the more potential he saw.There is evidence that the Sinai once was green \\u2013 as recently as 4,500 to 8,000 years ago. Cave paintings found there depict trees and plants. Records in the 1,500-year-old Saint Catherine\\u2019s monastery, near Mount Sinai, tally harvests of wood. Satellite images reveal a network of rivers flowing from the mountains in the south towards the Mediterranean.The Sinai peninsula today, and how it could look after regreening. Composite: The Weather MakersWhat turned the Sinai into a desert was, most likely, human activity. Wherever they settle, humans tend to chop down trees and clear land. This loss of vegetation affects the land\\u2019s ability to retain moisture. Grazing animals trample and consume plants when they try to grow back. The soil loses its structure and is washed away \\u2013 hence the silt in Lake Bardawil. Van der Hoeven calculated the lake contained about 2.5bn cubic metres of silt. If one were to restore the Sinai, this vast reserve of nutrient-rich material was exactly what would be needed. \\u201cIt became clear we had a massive opportunity,\\u201d he says. \\u201cIt wasn\\u2019t the solution to a single problem; it was the solution to all the problems.\\u201dBy this stage, Van der Hoeven and Deme agreed that he would be best off working as a separate entity, so in 2017 he founded the Weather Makers with two friends: Gijs Bosman and Maddie Akkermans. Both appear to be steadying influences. Bosman, a project manager at Dutch engineering firm Royal HaskoningDHV and a friend since student days, had the ability to translate Van der Hoeven\\u2019s grand vision into actionable technical detail. Akkermans has a background in finance and economics. \\u201cTies said, \\u2018I\\u2019m too chaotic. So I can\\u2019t do this alone,\\u2019\\u201d she says. \\u201cHaving someone like me who could tell him the truth and keep him on track gave him the confidence to start a company.\\u201dThey consulted with experts across disciplines, in particular a handful of veterans who have been ploughing the eco-restoration furrow for decades. Van der Hoeven calls them his \\u201cJedi\\u201d. The first of these is John D Liu, a Chinese-American ecologist with a background in broadcasting. Restoring a landscape as large and as degraded as the Sinai sounds like science fiction, but it has been done before. While Van der Hoeven was immersed in his research, a friend implored him to watch a documentary called Green Gold, which Liu had made for Dutch television in 2012. It chronicles the story of the Loess plateau, an area of northern China almost the size of France. In 1994, Liu, who was working as a television journalist in Beijing, was asked by the World Bank to film the start of an ambitious restoration project, led by a pioneering Chinese scientist, Li Rui. At that time, the Loess plateau was much like the Sinai: a dry, barren, heavily eroded landscape. The soil was washing away and silting up the Yellow river. Farmers could barely grow any crops. The plan to restore it was huge in scale but relatively low tech: planting trees on the hilltops; terracing the steep slopes (by hand); adding organic material to the soil; controlling grazing animals; retaining water. The transformation has been astonishing. Within 20 years, the deserts of the Loess plateau became green valleys and productive farmland, as Green Gold documents. \\u201cI watched it 35 times in a row,\\u201d says Van der Hoeven. \\u201cSeeing that, I thought, \\u2018Let\\u2019s go for it!\\u2019\\u201dTies van der Hoeven: \\u2018If we want to do something about global warming, we have to do something about deserts.\\u2019 Photograph: Judith Jockel/The GuardianThe Loess plateau project was also a turning point for Liu, he says \\u2013 away from broadcasting and towards ecosystem restoration: \\u201cYou start to see that everything is connected. It\\u2019s almost like you\\u2019re in the Matrix.\\u201d Despite his Jedi status, 68-year-old Liu is easygoing and conversational, more midwestern ex-hippy than cryptic Zen master. Since 2009, he has been an ambassador for Commonland, a Dutch nonprofit, and an adviser to Ecosystem Restoration Camps \\u2013 a global network of hands-on, volunteer communities.After watching Green Gold, the Weather Makers practically burst into Commonland\\u2019s Amsterdam headquarters to share their plans. \\u201cThey were not going to be denied!\\u201d Liu recalls. \\u201cI said, \\u2018We have to work with these people, because this is the most audacious thesis I\\u2019ve ever seen.\\u2019\\u201dLiu brought Van der Hoeven to China to see the Loess plateau first-hand. \\u201cTo be in a place that had been essentially a desert where now it\\u2019s raining cats and dogs, and it\\u2019s not flooding, because it\\u2019s being infiltrated and retained in the system \\u2013 it was all just so impressive to him.\\u201dThrough Liu, Van der Hoeven met another Jedi: Prof Mill\\u00e1n Mill\\u00e1n, a Spanish meteorologist. In the 1990s, Mill\\u00e1n began investigating the disappearance of summer storms in eastern Spain for the European commission. \\u201cWhat I found is that the loss is directly linked to the building up of coastal areas,\\u201d he says. Rainfall in the region comes almost entirely from Mediterranean sea breezes. However, the breeze alone doesn\\u2019t carry enough water vapour to create a storm inland; it needs to pick up extra moisture, which it used to do from the marshes and wetlands along the coast. Over the past two centuries, however, these wetlands have been built on or converted to farming land. No additional moisture; no more storms. \\u201cOnce you take too much vegetation out, it leads to desertification very quickly,\\u201d says Mill\\u00e1n.Such changes do not just affect the weather at a local level, Mill\\u00e1n discovered: \\u201cThe water vapour that doesn\\u2019t precipitate over the mountains goes back to the Mediterranean and accumulates in layers for about four or five days, and then it goes somewhere else: central Europe.\\u201d In other words, building on the Spanish coast was creating floods in Germany. Mill\\u00e1n\\u2019s findings have gone largely unheeded by the European commission, he says. Now 79 and retired, he speaks with the gentle weariness of a long-ignored expert: \\u201cMy criticism to them was: the old township barber would pull your teeth with pliers. It hurt, but it was effective. You\\u2019re still using those procedures, but you could save all your teeth.\\u201dMill\\u00e1n\\u2019s research and Liu\\u2019s experience in the Loess plateau arrived at essentially the same conclusion. Chop down the trees, destroy the ecosystem, and the rains disappear; restore the ecosystem, make a wetter landscape, and the rains come back. Mill\\u00e1n distilled his work down to a simple maxim: \\u201cWater begets water, soil is the womb, vegetation is the midwife.\\u201dDesertification and climate change is happening so fast, we need action on the ground. Enough seminars, talks, talks, talksRegreening the Sinai is to some extent a question of restarting that \\u201cwater begets water\\u201d feedback loop. After restoring Lake Bardawil, the second phase is to expand and restore the wetlands around it so as to evaporate more moisture and increase biodiversity. The Sinai coast is already a major global crossing point for migratory birds; restored wetlands would encourage more birds, which would add fertility and new plant species.When it comes to restoring inland areas of the Sinai, there is another challenge: fresh water. This is where another Jedi came into play: John Todd, a mild-mannered marine biologist and a pioneer in ecological design. In the 1970s, frustrated by the narrowness of academia, Todd established the New Alchemy Institute, an alternative research community in Massachusetts dedicated to sustainable living. One of his innovations was the \\u201ceco machine\\u201d \\u2013 a low-tech installation consisting of clear-sided water barrels covered by a greenhouse.\\u201cAn eco machine is basically a living technology,\\u201d Todd explains. The principle is that water flows from one barrel to the next, and each barrel contains a mini ecosystem: algae, plants, bacteria, fungi, worms, insects, fish; like a series of manmade ponds. As the water flows, it becomes cleaner and cleaner. \\u201cYou could design one that would treat toxic waste or sewage, or you could design one to grow food. They are solar-driven, and have within them a very large amount of biodiversity \\u2013 in a sense, they reflect the aggregate experience of life on Earth over the last 3.5bn years.\\u201d In the Sinai, eco machines would be used to grow plants and to produce fresh water.Last autumn, the Weather Makers built their own eco machine on a pig farm on the outskirts of the Dutch city of s\\u2019-Hertogenbosch, where they are based. For the first step in a plan to change the world, it is not exactly prepossessing. It looks like a standard agricultural polytunnel. On a cold, drizzly day, Weather Maker Pieter van Hout gives me a virtual tour. Inside the greenhouse are six clear-sided barrels filled with water of various shades of green and brown. In some of the tanks is leaf litter and dead plant material. Van Hout points out the brown algae growing on the sides: phytoplankton, the basis of the food web, which feeds life further up the chain: insects, snails and, in one tank, fish (in the Sinai these would be edible tilapia).The Weather Makers, from left, in their eco machine: Eduardo Vias Torres, Pieter van Hout, Maarten Lanters, Ties van der Hoeven, Maddie Akkermans, Gijs Bosman, Mohammed Nawlo. Photograph: Judith Jockel/The GuardianSome water evaporates from the barrels and condenses on the inside skin of the greenhouse, where it is collected by a system of gutters. Even on a cold day in the Netherlands, there is a constant trickle into a container on the ground. In the heat of the Sinai, the cycle would run much faster, says Van Hout. The water feeding the eco machine would be salt water, but the water that condenses inside would be fresh water, which can then be used to irrigate plants. If the structure is designed correctly, one would only need to drum on the outside to create an artificial \\u201crain\\u201d inside. When the plants and the soil inside the greenhouse reach a certain maturity, they become self-sustaining. The greenhouse can then be removed and the process repeated in a different spot. \\u201cThe idea is that you may have 100 of these structures,\\u201d says John Todd. \\u201cAnd they\\u2019re spending five years in one site and then they\\u2019re moved, so these little ecologies are left behind.\\u201dIn the Sinai, the sediment from Lake Bardawil would be pumped up to the hills, 50km inland, where it would then trickle back down through a network of eco machines. The saltiness of the sediment is actually an asset, says Van Hout, in that it has preserved all the nutrients. Flushing them through the eco machines will \\u201creactivate\\u201d them. Around the water tanks, they are now testing to see which salt-tolerant plant species, or halophytes, grow best. Van Hout proudly points out a stack of white plastic tubs containing silt freshly scooped from the bottom of Lake Bardawil. \\u201cThis is what ecosystem restoration looks like in real life,\\u201d he laughs, \\u201cbuckets of very expensive mud.\\u201dEstimates of how much difference a regreened Sinai could make are hard to quantify. In terms of carbon sequestration, it would doubtless be \\u201cbillions of tons\\u201d, says Van der Hoeven. But such metrics are not always helpful: if you convert atmospheric carbon into, say, phytoplankton, what happens when a fish eats that phytoplankton? Or when a bigger fish eats that fish?There are certain points in this world where, if we accumulate our joint energy, we can make a big differenceThe effect of regreening deserts is the subject of some debate. Deserts play a crucial role in cooling the planet since they reflect up to 30% of the solar radiation that falls on them back into space \\u2013 a measure known as albedo. Areas covered by vegetation are darker and less reflective, so have a lower albedo (10-15%), and thus absorb more sunlight, which could have a warming effect.Furthermore, of the remaining 70% of the solar radiation that is not reflected in deserts, around two-thirds is emitted back into the atmosphere as long-wave radiation; in other words, heat. With little cloud cover or moisture, much of that heat leaves the atmosphere and out into space \\u2013 another key mechanism for cooling the planet. Were the deserts regreened, climate scientists argue that these mechanisms would be affected.But the Weather Makers say these objections discount the effects a functional, biodiverse ecosystem would have on the earth\\u2019s weather and water systems. Ecosystems remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which deserts do not, thus helping alleviate the greenhouse effect \\u2013 albeit temporarily. Secondly, in wet, green areas the solar energy that would otherwise be emitted into the atmosphere as heat instead goes into evapotranspiration - evaporating water from the landscape - which has a cooling effect, though scientists say the cooling will be offset by the latent heat released when the water vapour condenses elsewhere.Their scheme may not \\u201cfix\\u201d climate change but the Weather Makers believe that, on a global scale, restored ecosystems and water cycles would help re-stabilise the out-of-balance weather systems that Mill\\u00e1n Mill\\u00e1n first identified. \\u201cThe climate regulator on earth is the biosphere,\\u201d says Bosman. \\u201cAll cycles depend on it. In the last 10,000 years we have removed more than half of this biosphere.\\u201dAt present, the hot Sinai acts as a \\u201cvacuum cleaner\\u201d, drawing moist air from the Mediterranean and funnelling it towards the Indian Ocean. A cooler Sinai would mean less of that moisture being \\u201clost\\u201d. Instead, it would fall as rain across the Middle East and north Africa, thus boosting the entire region\\u2019s natural potential. Van der Hoeven describes the Sinai peninsula as an \\u201cacupuncture point\\u201d: \\u201cThere are certain points in this world where, if we accumulate our joint energy, we can make a big difference.\\u201dThe Sinai is also an acupuncture point geopolitically, however. Post-Arab spring, the region has become a battle zone between Egyptian security forces and Islamist insurgents. There have been numerous terrorist incidents: the bombing of a Russian airliner in 2015 killed 224 people; an attack on a Sufi mosque in 2017 killed more than 300 worshippers. Northern Sinai is currently a no-go area to outsiders, controlled by the military, and plagued by poverty, terrorism and human rights abuses. Since 2018 the military has restricted access to Lake Bardawil for local fishermen to just a few months a year, says Ahmed Salem, founder of the UK-based Sinai Foundation for Human Rights. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a lot of suffering,\\u201d he says, \\u201cbecause they don\\u2019t have any other way to earn money and feed their families.\\u201d A restored landscape would bring tangible benefits to locals, says Salem, but it all depends on the president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. \\u201cIf Sisi really wants to help them [the Weather Makers], it will be OK for them because he\\u2019s like a god in Egypt. But if he doesn\\u2019t, they will fail.\\u201dBut the Sisi government seems to have recognised that ecosystem regeneration could fix many problems at once: food security, poverty, political stability, climate goals, as well as the potential for a green project of international renown. The government is close to signing contracts for the first phase of the restoration plan, which covers the dredging of Lake Bardawil. Subsequent phases may well require financial support from external bodies such as the EU.As outsiders, the Weather Makers are aware their plan will require local support, cooperation and labour. Because of the military restrictions, none of them has visited Lake Bardawil, although they have forged links with an organic farm in southern Sinai named Habiba. Habiba was established in 1994, by Maged El Said, a charismatic, Cairo-born tour operator who fell in love with the region. Originally it was a beach resort, but in 2007 El Said branched into organic farming, and Habiba now connects other farms, local Bedouin tribes and academic institutions.The Weather Makers have forged links with Habiba organic farm in southern Sinai. Photograph: Courtesy of Maged El SaidEl Said has some reservations about the Weather Makers\\u2019 plan: \\u201cIt\\u2019s a big shiny project, but also you\\u2019re drastically changing the environment, the flora and fauna. I don\\u2019t know if there will be side-effects.\\u201d But in terms of the larger mission, they are very much aligned: \\u201cWe are all in the same boat. Desertification and climate change is happening so fast, so we need action on the ground. Enough of workshops, enough seminars, talks, talks, talks.\\u201dOn a global level, the tide is turning in the Weather Makers\\u2019 direction. Discussions about regreening, reforestation and rewilding have been growing in volume and urgency, boosted by high-profile advocates such as Greta Thunberg, David Attenborough and British ecologist Thomas Crowther, who made headlines in 2019 with research suggesting the climate crisis could be solved by planting 1tn trees (he later acknowledged it was not quite that simple).This year marks the beginning of the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, \\u201ca rallying call for the protection and revival of ecosystems around the world\\u201d. The UN hopes to restore 350m hectares of land by 2030, which could remove an additional 13 to 26 gigatons of carbon from the atmosphere. After decades of compartmentalising environmental issues and missing its own targets, the UN, too, has come to realise that the only viable solution is to do it all at once. It particularly wants to rally younger people to the cause; its social media campaigns carry a \\u201cgeneration restoration\\u201d hashtag. \\u201cEcosystem restoration is not a technical challenge; it\\u2019s a social challenge,\\u201d says Tim Christophersen, head of the Nature for Climate branch at the UN Environment Programme.Nations and corporations are also making ever more ambitious commitments to regreening, even if they are struggling to live up to them. The UK, for example, plans to create 30,000 hectares of woodland a year by 2025. India has pledged to restore 26m hectares of degraded land by 2030. Africa\\u2019s Great Green Wall, \\u201cthe world\\u2019s largest ecosystem restoration project\\u201d, aims to plant an 8,000km line of trees across the Sahara Desert, from Senegal to Djibouti (14 years on, it is only around 15% complete). Meanwhile, green companies are taking root, such as Ecosia, the Berlin-based search engine, which to date has planted more than 120m trees around the world.\\u201cThe main challenge,\\u201d Christophersen says, \\u201cis the lack of human imagination; our inability to see a different future because we\\u2019re staring down this dystopian path of pandemic, climate change, biodiversity loss. But the collective awareness that we are in this together is a huge opportunity. People don\\u2019t have a problem imagining what a four-lane highway would look like. But to imagine a restored landscape of over a million hectares \\u2013 nobody knows what that would look like because it hasn\\u2019t really been done before.\\u201dVan der Hoeven would agree. He cites Yuval Noah Hariri\\u2019s book Sapiens, which argues that humans prevailed because of our ability to share information, ideas, stories: \\u201cWe were able to believe in a myth \\u2013 in something which was not there yet.\\u201dRegreening the Sinai is presently little more than a myth, just as the Apollo missions once were; but it now exists in the imagination, as a signpost for the future we aspire to. The more it is shared, the more likely it is to happen. It could come to be a turning point \\u2013 an acupuncture point: \\u201cWe\\u2019re not going to change humanity by saying, \\u2018Everything has to be less,\\u2019\\u201d says Van der Hoeven. \\u201cNo, we have to do more of the good things. Why don\\u2019t we come together and do something in a positive way?\\u201d This article was amended on 13 April and 11 June 2021. An earlier version said that \\u201cdeserts are heat producers, reflecting around 60% to 70% of the solar energy that falls on them straight back into the atmosphere\\u201d, and that increasing green areas would \\u201chelp cool the planet\\u201d. That paragraph has been replaced to acknowledge how climate scientists argue that regreening deserts would actually warm the planet. A quote from Gijs Bosman about the importance of the biosphere was also added.\",\n          \"Last Sunday, Steve Smith fidgeted to his second successive 62-ball century against India. The night before, Sydney broiled in its warmest November night (25.4 degrees at 1am), while Smithville recorded New South Wales\\u2019s hottest November temperature as the mercury hit 46.5 degrees. In rural New South Wales, bushfires are already burning and Australia\\u2019s rainfall for November was less than half what was expected. Yet, officially, the Australian summer started only on 1 December.The terrible bushfire season of 2019-20 killed or displaced three billion animals, killed 33 people, destroyed more than 3,000 homes and scorched 11.46m hectares of land as well as disrupting recreational cricket across the country and causing the cancellation of a Big Bash game in Canberra because of heavy smoke. But when two climate protesters ran on to the pitch at the SCG during the first one-day international against India, they weren\\u2019t just raising the profile of the climate crisis in Australia. They were also trying to raise awareness in India, where the State Bank of India is reported to be close to finalising a $1bn loan for Adani\\u2019s controversial coal project in Queensland. A loan would allow the company, finally, to dig the mine and build the railway to open up the Galilee Basin, one of the largest unexploited coal reserves in the world.The Spin | Gone in 11 seconds: how technology fixed cricket fixture headachesRead moreThe project has been tagged \\u201cthe most insane energy project on the planet\\u201d by Rolling Stone magazine and \\u201can act of climate vandalism that represents everything that has gone wrong with politics in the civilised world.\\u201d It threatens the survival of the Great Barrier Reef as well as releasing what climate groups estimate to be 4.6bn tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere. India, where most of the coal will be heading, is one of the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world and suffers from debilitating levels of air pollution in major cities, something that brought play to a temporary halt during a Delhi Test against Sri Lanka in 2017. The traditional owners of the land where the mine will be dug, the Wangan and Jagalingou people, have also protested the project would cause chaos to their way of life.Adani has been unable to find direct funding from any bank because of the reputational risk involved to anyone linked with the mine. The State Bank of India actually withdrew a proposed loan in 2015 after intense public pressure, and other companies are said to have refused to work with Adani on the project.Ben Burdett, one of the two protesters who clambered on to the SCG field, past bemused Indian fielders and the first crowd at a men\\u2019s international match since the pandemic, issued a statement: \\u201cMillions of Indian taxpayers who are watching the first game of the Indian cricket tour have a right to know the State Bank of India is considering handing their taxes to a billionaire\\u2019s climate-wrecking coal mine.\\u201d This was not, then, a direct attack on cricket or one of its corporate sponsors, but does hint at what is likely to come. Just as cigarette firms are no longer seen as suitable donors for sports teams, so big climate polluters will become increasingly undesirable as commercial partners. The invaluable youth market, one that poll after poll reveals to be increasingly panicked about the state of the planet, will demand it.Chennai Super Kings, owned by India Cements, celebrate IPL final glory in 2018. Photograph: Rafiq Maqbool/APRecently, Tottenham have come under pressure because their shirt sponsor AIA (an insurance company based in Hong Kong) is reported to have more than \\u00a33bn invested in coal. Spurs are not alone in having shirt sponsors from industries with dubious climate records but they are perhaps more vulnerable to pressure because of their reputation as a club that care about their own environmental stance. In October they signed up to the Count Us In initiative, which, among other things, promises to \\u201cchoose financial institutions and funds that invest responsibly\\u201d.Over on planet cricket, the Indian Premier League\\u2019s array of sponsors \\u2013 including (purely for your entertainment) an official confidence partner, official hygiene partner, official smile partner, stamina partner, official mask partner and official goodness partner among others \\u2013 is dazzling. Chennai Super Kings are owned by India Cements (the cement industry counts for 8% of the world\\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions) and sponsored by Gulf Oil; Sunrisers Hyderabad are sponsored by JK Lakshmi Cement. Meanwhile, Cricket Australia\\u2019s sponsor Alinta Energy is the seventh biggest climate polluter in the country.In the febrile financial seas in which we are currently bobbing, sports would not be blamed for clinging to any old port in a storm. But Forest Green Rovers, the famously sustainable League Two football club that have been certified carbon neutral by the United Nations, have seen their sponsorship revenue double over the past year, despite the after-effects of Covid. Gloucestershire CCC, the first UK cricket signatory to the UN\\u2019s Sports for Climate Action Framework, have found similar enthusiasm for their environmental stance. Forest Green\\u2019s owner, Dale Vince, has said many of their new sponsors have come not from companies traditionally linked to sport, but from \\u201cthe emerging or developing field of environmental products and services\\u201d.The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.The post-vaccine world we crawl towards in the spring has the chance to be a better one.

An air source heat pump running on renewable electricity will heat a home much more sustainably, which is why ministers are encouraging consumers to make the switch.\\u2018It\\u2019s been brilliant\\u2019: air source heat pump will recoup cost for ownerRead moreQ&AWhat are heat pumps and why is the UK government pushing them?ShowIn simple terms, an electric heat pump works like a reverse fridge, extracting warmth from the outside air, the ground or a nearby water source before concentrating the heat and transferring it indoors. They can usually be found outside a home, and they look like a standard air-conditioning unit.About 85% of UK homes use gas boilers for heating, making it one of the most polluting sectors of the economy. The fossil fuels used in our homes for heating, hot water and cooking make up more than a fifth of the UK\\u2019s carbon emissions, meaning low-carbon alternatives are critical if the UK government hopes to meet its climate targets.Jillian AmbrosePhotograph: KBImages/https://www.alamy.comWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.What are they and how do they work?In simple terms, an air source heat pump works like a reverse fridge, extracting warmth from the outside air before concentrating it and transferring it indoors to provide central heating and hot water. The pumps look like a standard air-conditioning unit and need to be situated outside the home. They will work at temperatures of minus 15c and lower, although the colder the outside temperature, the more electricity they need to consume to heat your home. Ground source heat pumps work in a similar way but collect the heat from pipes running underground. These are more efficient but are harder to retrofit to existing homes unless you are prepared to dig up your garden.An air source heat pump extracts warmth from the outside air before concentrating it and transferring it indoors to provide hot water and central heating. Photograph: Jenny Dettrick/Getty ImagesWhat does it cost to install one? Don\\u2019t believe some of the quoted prices that have appeared in recent days, someone with a family-size three-bed house and larger can expect to pay \\u00a38,000-\\u00a315,000 in total to install a complete air source system, while fitting out a bigger home will cost more. Alongside the pump, that price will include a new hot water tank and labour. The final bill will depend on whether your existing radiators are large enough or need to be replaced. You are also advised to upgrade your home\\u2019s insulation at the same time, which could add considerably to the final bill, depending on your home\\u2019s construction. Fitting a ground source pump will cost much more \\u2013 typically upwards of \\u00a315,000.What financial help is there?This week the government announced it will be giving households grants of \\u00a35,000 to help them install ASHPs, with the total money allocated enough to cover 90,000 homes. There will be grants of up to \\u00a36,000 available for ground source heat pumps.What has been less publicised is the fact that you can already apply for funding via the Renewable Heat IncentiveThe grants will be available from April 2022, and details of how consumers will apply are yet to be published. The scheme will operate for three years. It is highly likely that it will be oversubscribed, meaning those who can fulfil the criteria quickest will receive the grants.What has been less publicised is the fact that you can already apply for funding via the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI). Buyers have to pay for the work upfront and then reclaim the RHI payments, which are paid quarterly for the first seven years of ownership. The total paid to a household under the RHI depends on the measure installed, the home energy performance and the type and age of the boiler being replaced. Those replacing an old oil-fired boiler receive the most \\u2013 typically \\u00a39,000. If you replace an old gas boiler in a family-size house you can expect to receive a total \\u00a37,000. There is a calculator on the Gov website.To gain the RHI money you must use an MCS-accredited installer and there is a somewhat torturous application process. The RHI will close to new applications on 31 March 2022.What do air source heat pumps cost to run?People ripping out an inefficient old oil-burning boiler should reduce their annual energy bill by going for an ASHP \\u2013 but not by a huge amount. Those taking out a gas boiler are highly unlikely to see any savings and could well end up paying more each year. Octopus Energy says in a poorly insulated home it will cost as much as 40% more to run a heat pump rather than a traditional boiler. This is because the cost of electricity includes carbon taxes and subsidies to support low-carbon energy projects. Green groups have called on the government to move these levies on to gas bills instead to encourage households to turn their backs on oil and gas.Do they work as well as a conventional boiler?A properly installed ASHP system, which is the right size for the property, should keep house warm on the coldest winter days. They typically operate at 55C rather than the 60-80C that gas boilers will often work at, which is why they can require bigger radiators. They work particularly well with underfloor heating and are designed to keep indoor spaces at a steady temperature with gentle top-ups through the day.What are the downsides?Air source heat pumps will work at temperatures of minus 15c and lower, although the colder the outside temperature, the more electricity they need to consume to heat your home. Photograph: KBImages/AlamyThe biggest problem is that a great many UK homes are not suitable for an ASHP. Flat owners have struggled to get permission, and that\\u2019s assuming the installer has found a way to make a system work inside a confined space. Retrofitting a system with an existing boiler is not for the faint of heart on the basis that much of the plumbing will need to be replaced. You will also need a place to store a water tank.There have been concerns over the reliability and longevity of some systems. Mitsubishi pumps appear to be well regarded, as do those coming out of Scandinavia, and, more recently, the Northern Irish supplier, Red. Some installed in coastal towns have suffered premature wear because of the high salt content in the air.Is it worth it?If you are gutting and restoring a house and putting in a whole new heating system along with a major insulation upgrade, installing an ASHP \\u2013 or, even better, a ground source pump \\u2013 along with underfloor heating is a no-brainer. Equally, if you are currently running an old boiler that needs replacing anyway.Whether you will want to rip out a perfectly good, modern gas boiler will largely depend on how keen you are to move to zero carbon heating, the level of your home\\u2019s insulation and, if your insulation is poor, whether you are prepared to see your bills rise.Is it worth waiting for an alternative technology to emerge?Possibly. A great deal of investment is being put into community ground source heat systems, where whole roads, estates and tower blocks are plumbed into a central ground source that runs under the road. Simon Lomax, who runs Kensa Heat Pumps in Cornwall believes these offer a much better long-term solution as they are more efficient and durable, and don\\u2019t have many of the downsides of ASHPs. Hydrogen is the other great hope. Trials and schemes are testing whether the highly flammable element can be used safely.\",\n          \"On the Saturday before Labor Day, in the east Los Angeles neighborhood of Boyle Heights, temperatures outside climbed to 105F (41C). It was the fourth day of California\\u2019s longest September heatwave on record. That afternoon, the entire state was under a \\u201cflex alert\\u201d, in which Californians were asked to turn down their air conditioners and unplug appliances to avoid putting so much demand on the power grid that utilities would have to intermittently cut electricity.\\u2018Transformational\\u2019: could America\\u2019s new green bank be a climate gamechanger?Read moreBut at the Boyle Heights Arts Conservatory, or BHAC, children sat around a table engrossed in the role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons. The thermostat read a cool 72F.As a chaperone set down pizza lunches, Leo Felix, 11, surveyed his figurines and strategized his next move. When asked what he would be doing on a hot day like this if he weren\\u2019t at the BHAC, Felix shrugged. \\u201cI\\u2019d probably be outside, trying not to die from heat.\\u201dBHAC is a career training center that has been preparing young people for jobs in media arts for 11 years. But recently, BHAC has been taking on a new role in its community \\u2013 shielding some of east Los Angeles\\u2019s most vulnerable residents from extreme weather.The conservatory is an example of what is known in California and beyond as a \\u201cresilience center\\u201d \\u2013 a community space built to withstand climate disruptions like storms and power outages, but that also builds long-term preparedness by offering programs that improve people\\u2019s social, physical and economic health so they can withstand crises. Community members have found that temporary, reactive disaster responses like emergency shelters don\\u2019t adequately protect residents, and that, especially in disadvantaged communities, climate resilience must also address pre-existing inequities.As hazards like wildfire smoke, extreme heat and power outages last longer and happen more often, more communities across California are turning to these centers for support, and the state has committed nearly $200m in funding to developing more.A pedestrian uses an umbrella in the heat in Rosemead, California. Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty ImagesBut in this age of compounding climate emergencies, it is still unclear whether enough of this type of resilience infrastructure can be built \\u2013 and quickly enough \\u2013 to meet the needs of vulnerable communities.Beginning in 2012, Kristin Baja originated the concept of resilience centers while working as Baltimore\\u2019s climate resilience planner. She was going into neighborhoods to talk to people about emergency planning, but quickly recognized residents were not interested.At least, not as long as the local government was involved.\\u201cBaltimore has a legacy of racism and intentional discrimination,\\u201d Baja said. \\u201cIt became really clear that community members were not going to use disaster shelters because they were owned and managed by the government.\\u201dResidents also felt they had more pressing everyday concerns than when the next storm might come. High unemployment and a lack of childcare were more top of mind.To keep residents safe, solutions had to address not just weather-related hazards, but also the longstanding inequities the community faced. Baja changed course, working with residents to develop spaces that could provide backup energy, food, water and shelter \\u2013 but that would also offer after-school programs and job training.\\u201cWe\\u2019re shifting the approach from the hazard to the human,\\u201d said Baja, who is now director of direct support and innovation at the Urban Sustainability Directors Network (USDN), which helps organizations design strategies around resilience centers.By offering resources every day of the year, the center was strengthening the community\\u2019s ability to withstand disruptions, and it was building trust with residents before a crisis hit.\\u201cThey know there\\u2019s backup food, backup water, first aid,\\u201d said Baja. \\u201cThey\\u2019re much more likely to go to that space because they know they\\u2019re not going to be turned away or be treated poorly.\\u201dNot only are resilience centers more likely to be trusted by a community than government-led emergency services, they also offer a more practical and productive space to be during climate events than evacuation shelters or cooling centers.On the same Saturday that kids played Dungeons and Dragons at BHAC, only 190 people in a city of 4 million used the city\\u2019s emergency cooling centers, according to the city\\u2019s department of recreation and parks.\\u201cCooling centers are not well utilized because what you get is basically an empty gymnasium, where the temperature certainly is low, but it\\u2019s full of folding chairs and not much else,\\u201d said Chase Engelhardt, policy analyst at Climate Resolve, an advocacy group in Los Angeles.\\u201cPeople aren\\u2019t Sims,\\u201d he added, referring to the computer game. \\u201cThey won\\u2019t just go into a building, sit down for three hours and then leave once their body reaches some level of rest.\\u201dIn Boyle Heights, many residents don\\u2019t have air conditioners, or can\\u2019t afford to turn them on. To get people out of the heat, BHAC began designing programs that would attract people to the center without the stigma of needing help.Azareth Jimenez sits outside her mother\\u2019s store on Cesar E Chavez Avenue in Boyle Heights, Los Angeles. Photograph: Gabriela AounThey hosted an afternoon quilting club for elders. On Saturdays, they invited families to watch cartoons and eat cereal.BHAC recently upgraded their 100-year-old building with a hospital-grade air filtration and cooling system. They have installed air quality monitors on the building so they can alert residents when breathing conditions get dangerous. Soon, the center will have solar panels and battery storage that can provide backup power for three days. They will also have a cistern that can hold 500 gallons of potable water.The upgrades are important to ensure that BHAC can stay open in the event of a climate disruption. But the center\\u2019s best tool for keeping neighbors safe is that people enjoy being there.\\u201cWe do things that allow families to come and not have to have a pretext,\\u201d Ramirez Sanchez said. \\u201cYou can just say you came in to watch cartoons.\\u201dMost resilience centers will be born out of existing neighborhood spaces that residents are familiar with. But some communities, particularly in rural areas, may find their only option is to build centers from the ground up.Tuolumne county is about a three-hour drive south-east of Sacramento. It\\u2019s largely made up of national forest and contains northern portions of Yosemite national park. The county is a few months away from completing construction on two brand-new resilience centers. The projects have been in development since 2015.In 2013, the Rim Fire burned more than 250,000 acres in the area, destroyed 11 homes and caused evacuations that lasted weeks. \\u201cWhen Tuolumne started recovering from the Rim fire, the first thing we did was talk about what would make us more resilient as a community,\\u201d said Maureen Frank, capital projects director of Tuolumne county. \\u201cThe community wanted better response and recovery to and from emergencies, but they also wanted improved access to services.\\u201dLiving in a remote area meant that many doctor\\u2019s offices were more than 30 miles away, across winding mountain passes. Riding the bus to and from the nearest food bank took a whole day. Residents lived far from one another, and felt socially isolated. They wanted a place to gather.One of the new buildings, the Groveland Community Resilience Center, is equipped with heavy-duty heating and cooling systems, fortified with an ignition-resistant exterior, backed up by a diesel power generator, and is large enough to shelter as many as 75 people indoors at a time. But it will also provide weekly food-bank distribution, offer counseling services, and host community college classes.The resilience center also has a large outdoor amphitheater for events and a walking trail for people to meet up and socialize. \\u201cIt will be a living, breathing building, used seven days a week,\\u201d said Frank.Maureen Frank and Taylor Gold stand inside what will be the main gathering space at the Groveland Resilience Center. Photograph: Gabriela AounThe centers are scheduled to open in a few months, but as construction carried on at the Groveland Resilience Center this summer, the need was clear. On a late July morning at the construction site for the Groveland Resilience Center, the sky looked clear, but the air was thick with the smell of smoke. The Oak fire was burning in neighboring Mariposa county. It destroyed more than 60 homes and forced 6,000 people to evacuate.\\u201cIt would have been nice to have this opened,\\u201d Frank said, \\u201cso we could help.\\u201dAs resilience centers prove their effectiveness, the question becomes how many can be built, and how quickly. Developing a center can cost millions of dollars. Battery storage for microgrids is still very expensive, and some buildings need substantial upgrades before they can be outfitted with solar panels or HVAC systems.Last year, California allocated $100m toward grant programs to fund resilience center projects. But Patrick Murphy, a senior scientist at the policy institute Physicians, Scientists and Engineers for Healthy Energy (PSE), said that in proportion to the need, that is merely a drop in the bucket.Through a grant from the state, PSE is working on a mapping tool to identify which communities in California are most vulnerable to climate change, power grid vulnerabilities, health disparities and socioeconomic inequalities. They\\u2019re also aiming to identify all the possible spaces in the state where resilience hubs could be developed, including schools, community centers and churches.Murphy worries that when the study is complete, it will reveal a huge need. \\u201cOne hundred million is a good start,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut this is a multibillion-dollar problem.\\u201dIn response to concerns that interest in resilience centers far exceeded available funding, the legislature directed an additional $85m to resilience center grants in a bill that Governor Gavin Newsom signed this month.Coral Abbott, community resilience centers program manager at the California Strategic Growth Council, which will distribute the funding, said that the grants will support pilot projects in rural, urban and suburban areas. \\u201cThey will be able to serve as models that can be replicated by other communities in the future,\\u201d said Abbott.In the meantime, existing centers like BHAC are already modeling how resilience centers might allow communities to not just survive climate disruptions, but to thrive through them. When Felix\\u2019s dad, Roland, came to pick him up from the Dungeons and Dragons session, he called BHAC a \\u201clifesaver\\u201d. Playing the game made his son use critical thinking skills and offered him much-needed in-person interaction with peers.And then, of course, there was the heat. \\u201cWhen it\\u2019s hot, we try to find recreation,\\u201d the elder Felix said. \\u201cThis helps.\\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Date Published\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2207,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2020-06-26\",\n          \"2019-11-28\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"mood\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.06201415021479863,\n        \"min\": -0.31,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 29419,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.06374768089053802,\n          0.04859477124183005\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

An air source heat pump running on renewable electricity will heat a home much more sustainably, which is why ministers are encouraging consumers to make the switch.\\u2018It\\u2019s been brilliant\\u2019: air source heat pump will recoup cost for ownerRead moreQ&AWhat are heat pumps and why is the UK government pushing them?ShowIn simple terms, an electric heat pump works like a reverse fridge, extracting warmth from the outside air, the ground or a nearby water source before concentrating the heat and transferring it indoors. They can usually be found outside a home, and they look like a standard air-conditioning unit.About 85% of UK homes use gas boilers for heating, making it one of the most polluting sectors of the economy. The fossil fuels used in our homes for heating, hot water and cooking make up more than a fifth of the UK\\u2019s carbon emissions, meaning low-carbon alternatives are critical if the UK government hopes to meet its climate targets.Jillian AmbrosePhotograph: KBImages/https://www.alamy.comWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.What are they and how do they work?In simple terms, an air source heat pump works like a reverse fridge, extracting warmth from the outside air before concentrating it and transferring it indoors to provide central heating and hot water. The pumps look like a standard air-conditioning unit and need to be situated outside the home. They will work at temperatures of minus 15c and lower, although the colder the outside temperature, the more electricity they need to consume to heat your home. Ground source heat pumps work in a similar way but collect the heat from pipes running underground. These are more efficient but are harder to retrofit to existing homes unless you are prepared to dig up your garden.An air source heat pump extracts warmth from the outside air before concentrating it and transferring it indoors to provide hot water and central heating. Photograph: Jenny Dettrick/Getty ImagesWhat does it cost to install one? Don\\u2019t believe some of the quoted prices that have appeared in recent days, someone with a family-size three-bed house and larger can expect to pay \\u00a38,000-\\u00a315,000 in total to install a complete air source system, while fitting out a bigger home will cost more. Alongside the pump, that price will include a new hot water tank and labour. The final bill will depend on whether your existing radiators are large enough or need to be replaced. You are also advised to upgrade your home\\u2019s insulation at the same time, which could add considerably to the final bill, depending on your home\\u2019s construction. Fitting a ground source pump will cost much more \\u2013 typically upwards of \\u00a315,000.What financial help is there?This week the government announced it will be giving households grants of \\u00a35,000 to help them install ASHPs, with the total money allocated enough to cover 90,000 homes. There will be grants of up to \\u00a36,000 available for ground source heat pumps.What has been less publicised is the fact that you can already apply for funding via the Renewable Heat IncentiveThe grants will be available from April 2022, and details of how consumers will apply are yet to be published. The scheme will operate for three years. It is highly likely that it will be oversubscribed, meaning those who can fulfil the criteria quickest will receive the grants.What has been less publicised is the fact that you can already apply for funding via the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI). Buyers have to pay for the work upfront and then reclaim the RHI payments, which are paid quarterly for the first seven years of ownership. The total paid to a household under the RHI depends on the measure installed, the home energy performance and the type and age of the boiler being replaced. Those replacing an old oil-fired boiler receive the most \\u2013 typically \\u00a39,000. If you replace an old gas boiler in a family-size house you can expect to receive a total \\u00a37,000. There is a calculator on the Gov website.To gain the RHI money you must use an MCS-accredited installer and there is a somewhat torturous application process. The RHI will close to new applications on 31 March 2022.What do air source heat pumps cost to run?People ripping out an inefficient old oil-burning boiler should reduce their annual energy bill by going for an ASHP \\u2013 but not by a huge amount. Those taking out a gas boiler are highly unlikely to see any savings and could well end up paying more each year. Octopus Energy says in a poorly insulated home it will cost as much as 40% more to run a heat pump rather than a traditional boiler. This is because the cost of electricity includes carbon taxes and subsidies to support low-carbon energy projects. Green groups have called on the government to move these levies on to gas bills instead to encourage households to turn their backs on oil and gas.Do they work as well as a conventional boiler?A properly installed ASHP system, which is the right size for the property, should keep house warm on the coldest winter days. They typically operate at 55C rather than the 60-80C that gas boilers will often work at, which is why they can require bigger radiators. They work particularly well with underfloor heating and are designed to keep indoor spaces at a steady temperature with gentle top-ups through the day.What are the downsides?Air source heat pumps will work at temperatures of minus 15c and lower, although the colder the outside temperature, the more electricity they need to consume to heat your home. Photograph: KBImages/AlamyThe biggest problem is that a great many UK homes are not suitable for an ASHP. Flat owners have struggled to get permission, and that\\u2019s assuming the installer has found a way to make a system work inside a confined space. Retrofitting a system with an existing boiler is not for the faint of heart on the basis that much of the plumbing will need to be replaced. You will also need a place to store a water tank.There have been concerns over the reliability and longevity of some systems. Mitsubishi pumps appear to be well regarded, as do those coming out of Scandinavia, and, more recently, the Northern Irish supplier, Red. Some installed in coastal towns have suffered premature wear because of the high salt content in the air.Is it worth it?If you are gutting and restoring a house and putting in a whole new heating system along with a major insulation upgrade, installing an ASHP \\u2013 or, even better, a ground source pump \\u2013 along with underfloor heating is a no-brainer. Equally, if you are currently running an old boiler that needs replacing anyway.Whether you will want to rip out a perfectly good, modern gas boiler will largely depend on how keen you are to move to zero carbon heating, the level of your home\\u2019s insulation and, if your insulation is poor, whether you are prepared to see your bills rise.Is it worth waiting for an alternative technology to emerge?Possibly. A great deal of investment is being put into community ground source heat systems, where whole roads, estates and tower blocks are plumbed into a central ground source that runs under the road. Simon Lomax, who runs Kensa Heat Pumps in Cornwall believes these offer a much better long-term solution as they are more efficient and durable, and don\\u2019t have many of the downsides of ASHPs. Hydrogen is the other great hope. Trials and schemes are testing whether the highly flammable element can be used safely.\",\n          \"On the Saturday before Labor Day, in the east Los Angeles neighborhood of Boyle Heights, temperatures outside climbed to 105F (41C). It was the fourth day of California\\u2019s longest September heatwave on record. That afternoon, the entire state was under a \\u201cflex alert\\u201d, in which Californians were asked to turn down their air conditioners and unplug appliances to avoid putting so much demand on the power grid that utilities would have to intermittently cut electricity.\\u2018Transformational\\u2019: could America\\u2019s new green bank be a climate gamechanger?Read moreBut at the Boyle Heights Arts Conservatory, or BHAC, children sat around a table engrossed in the role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons. The thermostat read a cool 72F.As a chaperone set down pizza lunches, Leo Felix, 11, surveyed his figurines and strategized his next move. When asked what he would be doing on a hot day like this if he weren\\u2019t at the BHAC, Felix shrugged. \\u201cI\\u2019d probably be outside, trying not to die from heat.\\u201dBHAC is a career training center that has been preparing young people for jobs in media arts for 11 years. But recently, BHAC has been taking on a new role in its community \\u2013 shielding some of east Los Angeles\\u2019s most vulnerable residents from extreme weather.The conservatory is an example of what is known in California and beyond as a \\u201cresilience center\\u201d \\u2013 a community space built to withstand climate disruptions like storms and power outages, but that also builds long-term preparedness by offering programs that improve people\\u2019s social, physical and economic health so they can withstand crises. Community members have found that temporary, reactive disaster responses like emergency shelters don\\u2019t adequately protect residents, and that, especially in disadvantaged communities, climate resilience must also address pre-existing inequities.As hazards like wildfire smoke, extreme heat and power outages last longer and happen more often, more communities across California are turning to these centers for support, and the state has committed nearly $200m in funding to developing more.A pedestrian uses an umbrella in the heat in Rosemead, California. Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty ImagesBut in this age of compounding climate emergencies, it is still unclear whether enough of this type of resilience infrastructure can be built \\u2013 and quickly enough \\u2013 to meet the needs of vulnerable communities.Beginning in 2012, Kristin Baja originated the concept of resilience centers while working as Baltimore\\u2019s climate resilience planner. She was going into neighborhoods to talk to people about emergency planning, but quickly recognized residents were not interested.At least, not as long as the local government was involved.\\u201cBaltimore has a legacy of racism and intentional discrimination,\\u201d Baja said. \\u201cIt became really clear that community members were not going to use disaster shelters because they were owned and managed by the government.\\u201dResidents also felt they had more pressing everyday concerns than when the next storm might come. High unemployment and a lack of childcare were more top of mind.To keep residents safe, solutions had to address not just weather-related hazards, but also the longstanding inequities the community faced. Baja changed course, working with residents to develop spaces that could provide backup energy, food, water and shelter \\u2013 but that would also offer after-school programs and job training.\\u201cWe\\u2019re shifting the approach from the hazard to the human,\\u201d said Baja, who is now director of direct support and innovation at the Urban Sustainability Directors Network (USDN), which helps organizations design strategies around resilience centers.By offering resources every day of the year, the center was strengthening the community\\u2019s ability to withstand disruptions, and it was building trust with residents before a crisis hit.\\u201cThey know there\\u2019s backup food, backup water, first aid,\\u201d said Baja. \\u201cThey\\u2019re much more likely to go to that space because they know they\\u2019re not going to be turned away or be treated poorly.\\u201dNot only are resilience centers more likely to be trusted by a community than government-led emergency services, they also offer a more practical and productive space to be during climate events than evacuation shelters or cooling centers.On the same Saturday that kids played Dungeons and Dragons at BHAC, only 190 people in a city of 4 million used the city\\u2019s emergency cooling centers, according to the city\\u2019s department of recreation and parks.\\u201cCooling centers are not well utilized because what you get is basically an empty gymnasium, where the temperature certainly is low, but it\\u2019s full of folding chairs and not much else,\\u201d said Chase Engelhardt, policy analyst at Climate Resolve, an advocacy group in Los Angeles.\\u201cPeople aren\\u2019t Sims,\\u201d he added, referring to the computer game. \\u201cThey won\\u2019t just go into a building, sit down for three hours and then leave once their body reaches some level of rest.\\u201dIn Boyle Heights, many residents don\\u2019t have air conditioners, or can\\u2019t afford to turn them on. To get people out of the heat, BHAC began designing programs that would attract people to the center without the stigma of needing help.Azareth Jimenez sits outside her mother\\u2019s store on Cesar E Chavez Avenue in Boyle Heights, Los Angeles. Photograph: Gabriela AounThey hosted an afternoon quilting club for elders. On Saturdays, they invited families to watch cartoons and eat cereal.BHAC recently upgraded their 100-year-old building with a hospital-grade air filtration and cooling system. They have installed air quality monitors on the building so they can alert residents when breathing conditions get dangerous. Soon, the center will have solar panels and battery storage that can provide backup power for three days. They will also have a cistern that can hold 500 gallons of potable water.The upgrades are important to ensure that BHAC can stay open in the event of a climate disruption. But the center\\u2019s best tool for keeping neighbors safe is that people enjoy being there.\\u201cWe do things that allow families to come and not have to have a pretext,\\u201d Ramirez Sanchez said. \\u201cYou can just say you came in to watch cartoons.\\u201dMost resilience centers will be born out of existing neighborhood spaces that residents are familiar with. But some communities, particularly in rural areas, may find their only option is to build centers from the ground up.Tuolumne county is about a three-hour drive south-east of Sacramento. It\\u2019s largely made up of national forest and contains northern portions of Yosemite national park. The county is a few months away from completing construction on two brand-new resilience centers. The projects have been in development since 2015.In 2013, the Rim Fire burned more than 250,000 acres in the area, destroyed 11 homes and caused evacuations that lasted weeks. \\u201cWhen Tuolumne started recovering from the Rim fire, the first thing we did was talk about what would make us more resilient as a community,\\u201d said Maureen Frank, capital projects director of Tuolumne county. \\u201cThe community wanted better response and recovery to and from emergencies, but they also wanted improved access to services.\\u201dLiving in a remote area meant that many doctor\\u2019s offices were more than 30 miles away, across winding mountain passes. Riding the bus to and from the nearest food bank took a whole day. Residents lived far from one another, and felt socially isolated. They wanted a place to gather.One of the new buildings, the Groveland Community Resilience Center, is equipped with heavy-duty heating and cooling systems, fortified with an ignition-resistant exterior, backed up by a diesel power generator, and is large enough to shelter as many as 75 people indoors at a time. But it will also provide weekly food-bank distribution, offer counseling services, and host community college classes.The resilience center also has a large outdoor amphitheater for events and a walking trail for people to meet up and socialize. \\u201cIt will be a living, breathing building, used seven days a week,\\u201d said Frank.Maureen Frank and Taylor Gold stand inside what will be the main gathering space at the Groveland Resilience Center. Photograph: Gabriela AounThe centers are scheduled to open in a few months, but as construction carried on at the Groveland Resilience Center this summer, the need was clear. On a late July morning at the construction site for the Groveland Resilience Center, the sky looked clear, but the air was thick with the smell of smoke. The Oak fire was burning in neighboring Mariposa county. It destroyed more than 60 homes and forced 6,000 people to evacuate.\\u201cIt would have been nice to have this opened,\\u201d Frank said, \\u201cso we could help.\\u201dAs resilience centers prove their effectiveness, the question becomes how many can be built, and how quickly. Developing a center can cost millions of dollars. Battery storage for microgrids is still very expensive, and some buildings need substantial upgrades before they can be outfitted with solar panels or HVAC systems.Last year, California allocated $100m toward grant programs to fund resilience center projects. But Patrick Murphy, a senior scientist at the policy institute Physicians, Scientists and Engineers for Healthy Energy (PSE), said that in proportion to the need, that is merely a drop in the bucket.Through a grant from the state, PSE is working on a mapping tool to identify which communities in California are most vulnerable to climate change, power grid vulnerabilities, health disparities and socioeconomic inequalities. They\\u2019re also aiming to identify all the possible spaces in the state where resilience hubs could be developed, including schools, community centers and churches.Murphy worries that when the study is complete, it will reveal a huge need. \\u201cOne hundred million is a good start,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut this is a multibillion-dollar problem.\\u201dIn response to concerns that interest in resilience centers far exceeded available funding, the legislature directed an additional $85m to resilience center grants in a bill that Governor Gavin Newsom signed this month.Coral Abbott, community resilience centers program manager at the California Strategic Growth Council, which will distribute the funding, said that the grants will support pilot projects in rural, urban and suburban areas. \\u201cThey will be able to serve as models that can be replicated by other communities in the future,\\u201d said Abbott.In the meantime, existing centers like BHAC are already modeling how resilience centers might allow communities to not just survive climate disruptions, but to thrive through them. When Felix\\u2019s dad, Roland, came to pick him up from the Dungeons and Dragons session, he called BHAC a \\u201clifesaver\\u201d. Playing the game made his son use critical thinking skills and offered him much-needed in-person interaction with peers.And then, of course, there was the heat. \\u201cWhen it\\u2019s hot, we try to find recreation,\\u201d the elder Felix said. \\u201cThis helps.\\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Date Published\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2207,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2020-06-26\",\n          \"2019-11-28\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"mood\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.06201415021479863,\n        \"min\": -0.31,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 29419,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.06374768089053802,\n          0.04859477124183005\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"positive\",\n          \"negative\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
